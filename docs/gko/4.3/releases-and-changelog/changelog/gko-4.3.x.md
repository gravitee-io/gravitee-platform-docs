## Gravitee Kubernetes Operator 4.3.7 - June 24, 2024

GKO 4.3.7 is a tag based on GKO 0.13.1. For details of changes that came in releases from GKO 4.3.7 and earlier, please take a look at the change logs in Github.

There is a change in the compatibility policies between GKO 4.3 and GKO 4.4. As of GKO 4.4, GKO follows a strict compatibility policy whereby a given minor version of GKO requires the same minor version of APIM. As such, GKO 4.4 is compatible with APIM 4.4.

GKO 4.3 is compatible for the most part with APIM 4.3, 4.2, and 4.1.
