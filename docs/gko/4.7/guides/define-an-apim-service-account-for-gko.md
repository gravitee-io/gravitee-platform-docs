# Define an APIM service account for GKO

The best way to provide GKO with credentials to connect to your APIM installation through a `ManagementContext` is to create a service account for GKO in the Gravitee APIM Console.

To create a service account, go to the organization settings in APIM, create a new user, and choose **Service Account**. Entering the service account email is optional.

Next, ensure that this service account has the ADMIN role on the organization, and the API\_PUBLISHER role on the desired environment. This will provide GKO with the minimum set of  permissions required to manage APIs, applications, and other assets in APIM.

The screenshot below shows the environment-level permissions included in the API\_PUBLISHER role:

From the newly created service account, scroll to the **Tokens** section at the bottom of the page and create a new token:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Immediately copy your new personal access token. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again.
{% endhint %}

You can now use this token as credentials in a `ManagementContext`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gravitee.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagementContext
metadata:
  name: dev-mgmt-ctx
spec:
  baseUrl: http://localhost:8083
  environmentId: DEFAULT
  organizationId: DEFAULT
  auth:
    bearerToken: xxxx-yyyy-zzzz
```
