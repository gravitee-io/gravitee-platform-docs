# GKO 4.10

## Gateway API Conformance Achievement

We're excited to announce that **Gravitee Kubernetes Operator 4.10 maintains partial conformance** with the Kubernetes Gateway API specification version 1.3! This milestone, first achieved in version 4.8.5, recognizes our commitment to providing a standards-compliant API gateway solution for Kubernetes environments.

The Gravitee Kubernetes Operator is now officially listed as a **Partially Conformant** implementation on the [Gateway API implementations page](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/#gravitee-kubernetes-operator), joining a select group of gateway providers recognized by the Kubernetes community.

### What This Means for You

**Gravitee Kubernetes Operator 4.10** delivers partial conformance for Gateway - HTTP features, enabling you to leverage the Gateway API standard for managing your API infrastructure. While the current implementation focuses on core Gateway and HTTPRoute functionality with Kubernetes Core v1 services, we're working on expanding support for additional matching rules across routes and alternative service types in upcoming releases.
