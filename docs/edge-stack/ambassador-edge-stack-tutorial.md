# Ambassador Edge Stack Tutorial

In this article, you will explore some of the key features of Ambassador Edge Stack by walking through an example workflow and exploring the Edge Policy Console.

## Prerequisites

You must have Ambassador Edge Stack installed in your Kubernetes cluster. See [.](./ "mention") for more information.

## Routing Traffic from the Edge

Like any other Kubernetes object, Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are used to declaratively define Ambassador Edge Stackâ€™s desired state. The workflow you are going to build uses a sample deployment and the `Mapping` CRD, which is the core resource that you will use with Ambassador Edge Stack to manage your edge. It enables you to route requests by host and URL path from the edge of your cluster to Kubernetes services.

1. Copy the configuration below and save it to a file named `quote.yaml` so that you can deploy these resources to your cluster. This basic configuration creates the `quote` deployment and a service to expose that deployment on port 80.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: quote
  namespace: ambassador
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: quote
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: quote
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: docker.io/datawire/quote:0.5.0
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: quote
  namespace: ambassador
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: quote
```

1. Apply the configuration to the cluster with the command `kubectl apply -f quote.yaml`.
2. Copy the configuration below and save it to a file called `quote-backend.yaml` so that you can create a `Mapping` on your cluster. This `Mapping` tells Ambassador Edge Stack to route all traffic inbound to the `/backend/` path, on any host that can be used to reach Ambassador Edge Stack, to the `quote` service.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Mapping
metadata:
  name: quote-backend
  namespace: ambassador
spec:
  hostname: "*"
  prefix: /backend/
  service: quote
```

1. Apply the configuration to the cluster with the command `kubectl apply -f quote-backend.yaml`
2. Store the Ambassador Edge Stack `LoadBalancer` address to a local environment variable. You will use this variable to test accessing your pod.

```
export AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl -n ambassador get svc ambassador -o "go-template={{range .status.loadBalancer.ingress}}{{or .ip .hostname}}{{end}}")
```

1. Test the configuration by accessing the service through the Ambassador Edge Stack load balancer.

```
$ curl -Lk "https://$AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT/backend/"
{
 "server": "idle-cranberry-8tbb6iks",
 "quote": "Non-locality is the driver of truth. By summoning, we vibrate.",
 "time": "2019-12-11T20:10:16.525471212Z"
}
```

Success, you have created your first Ambassador Edge Stack `Mapping`, routing a request from your cluster's edge to a service!

Since the `Mapping` you just created controls how requests are routed, changing the `Mapping` will immediately change the routing. To see this in action, use `kubectl` to edit the `Mapping`:

1. Run `kubectl edit Mapping quote-backend`.
2. Change `prefix: /backend/` to `prefix: /quoteme/`.
3. Save the file and let `kubectl` update your `Mapping`.
4. Run `kubectl get Mappings --namespace ambassador`. You will see the `quote-backend` `Mapping` has the updated prefix listed. Try to access the endpoint again via `curl` with the updated prefix.

```
$ kubectl get Mappings --namespace ambassador
NAME            PREFIX      SERVICE   STATE   REASON
quote-backend   /quoteme/   quote

$ curl -Lk "https://${AMBASSADOR_LB_ENDPOINT}/quoteme/"
{
    "server": "snippy-apple-ci10n7qe",
    "quote": "A principal idea is omnipresent, much like candy.",
    "time": "2020-11-18T17:15:42.095153306Z"
}
```

1. Change the prefix back to `/backend/` so that you can later use the `Mapping` with other tutorials.

## Developer API Documentation

The `quote` service you just deployed publishes its API as an [OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)](https://swagger.io/solutions/getting-started-with-oas/) document. Ambassador Edge Stack automatically detects and publishes this documentation. This can help with internal and external developer onboarding by serving as a single point of reference for of all your microservice APIs.

1. In the Edge Policy Console, navigate to the **APIs** tab. You'll see the OpenAPI documentation there for the "Quote Service API." Click **GET** to expand out the documentation.
2. Navigate to `https://<load-balancer-endpoint>/docs/` to see the publicly visible Developer Portal. Make sure you include the trailing `/`. This is a fully customizable portal that you can share with third parties who need information about your APIs.

## Next Steps

Further explore some of the concepts you learned about in this article:

* [the-mapping-resource.md](technical-reference/using-custom-resources/the-mapping-resource.md "mention"): routes traffic from the edge of your cluster to a Kubernetes service
* [the-host-resource.md](technical-reference/using-custom-resources/the-host-resource.md "mention"): sets the hostname by which Ambassador Edge Stack will be accessed and secured with TLS certificates
* [developer-portal.md](technical-reference/api/developer-portal.md "mention"): publishes an API catalog and OpenAPI documentation

Ambassador Edge Stack has a comprehensive range of features to support the requirements of any edge microservice.

For a custom configuration, you can install Ambassador Edge Stack manually. See [.](./ "mention") for more information.
