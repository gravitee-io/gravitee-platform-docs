# Get Traffic from the Edge

The core Ambassador Edge Stack resource used to manage cluster ingress is the `Mapping` resource.

**A `Mapping` resource routes a URL path (or prefix) to a service (either a Kubernetes service or other web service).**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember that `Listener` and `Host` resources are  required for a functioning Ambassador Edge Stack installation that can route traffic!\
Learn more about `Listener`: [the-listener-resource.md](../../technical-reference/using-custom-resources/the-listener-resource.md "mention")\
Learn more about `Host`: [the-host-resource.md](../../technical-reference/using-custom-resources/the-host-resource.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

### Examples

This `Mapping` would route requests to `https://<hostname>/webapp/` to the `webapp-svc` Service. **This is not a complete example on its own; see below.**

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind:  Mapping
metadata:
  name:  webapp-mapping
spec:
  prefix: /webapp/
  service: webapp-svc
```

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `metadata.name` | String | Identifies the Mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `spec.prefix`   | String | The URL prefix identifying your resource. [See below](get-traffic-from-the-edge.md#resources) on how Ambassador Edge Stack handles resources.                                                                                                                                       |
| `spec.service`  | String | The service handling the resource. If a Kubernetes service, it must include the namespace (in the format `service.namespace`) if the service is in a different namespace than Ambassador Edge Stack. [See below](get-traffic-from-the-edge.md#services) on service name formatting. |

Here's another example using a web service that maps requests to `/httpbin/` to `http://httpbin.org` (again, **this is not a complete example on its own; see below**):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind:  Mapping
metadata:
  name:  httpbin-mapping
spec:
  prefix: /httpbin/
  service: http://httpbin.org
  hostname: '*'
```

#### Complete example configuration

For demonstration purposes, here's a possible way of combining a `Listener`, a `Host`, and both `Mapping`s above that is complete and functional:

* it will accept HTTP or HTTPS on port 8443;
* Ambassador Edge Stack is terminating TLS;
* HTTPS to `foo.example.com` will be routed as above;
* HTTP to `foo.example.com` will be redirected to HTTPS;
* HTTP or HTTPS to other hostnames will be rejected; and
* the associations between the `Listener`, the `Host`, and the `Mappings` use Kubernetes `label`s.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/tls
metadata:
  name: foo-example-secret
data:
  tls.crt: -certificate PEM-
  tls.key: -secret key PEM-
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Listener
metadata:
  name: listener-8443
spec:
  port: 8443
  protocol: HTTPS
  securityModel: XFP
  hostBinding:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        exampleName: basic-https
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Host
metadata:
  name: foo-host
  labels:
    exampleName: basic-https
spec:
  hostname: "foo.example.com"
  tlsSecret:
    name: foo-example-secret
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      exampleName: basic-https
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind:  Mapping
metadata:
  name:  webapp-mapping
  labels:
    exampleName: basic-https
spec:
  prefix: /webapp/
  service: webapp-svc
  hostname: 'foo.example.com'
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind:  Mapping
metadata:
  name:  httpbin-mapping
  labels:
    exampleName: basic-https
spec:
  prefix: /httpbin/
  service: http://httpbin.org
  hostname: 'foo.example.com'

```

Note the addition of `label`s and `selector`s to explicitly specify which resources should associate in this example.

### Applying a Mapping resource

A Mapping resource can be managed using the same workflow as any other Kubernetes resources (like a Service or Deployment). For example, if the above Mapping is saved into a file called `httpbin-mapping.yaml`, the following command will apply the configuration directly to Ambassador Edge Stack:

```
kubectl apply -f httpbin-mapping.yaml
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For production use, best practice is to store the file in a version control system and apply the changes with a continuous deployment pipeline. The Ambassador Operating Model provides more detail.
{% endhint %}

### Resources

To Ambassador Edge Stack, a resource is a group of one or more URLs that all share a common prefix in the URL path. For example, these URLs all share the `/resource1/` path prefix, so `/resource1/` can be considered a single resource:

* `https://ambassador.example.com/resource1/foo`
* `https://ambassador.example.com/resource1/bar`
* `https://ambassador.example.com/resource1/baz/zing`

On the other hand, these URLs share only the prefix `/` -- you _could_ tell Ambassador Edge Stack to treat them as a single resource, but it's probably not terribly useful.

* `https://ambassador.example.com/resource1/foo`
* `https://ambassador.example.com/resource2/bar`
* `https://ambassador.example.com/resource3/baz/zing`

Note that the length of the prefix doesn't matter; a prefix like `/v1/this/is/my/very/long/resource/name/` is valid.

Also note that Ambassador Edge Stack does not actually require the prefix to start and end with `/` -- however, in practice, it's a good idea. Specifying a prefix of `/man` would match all of the following, which probably is not what was intended:

* `https://ambassador.example.com/man/foo`
* `https://ambassador.example.com/mankind`
* `https://ambassador.example.com/man-it-is/really-hot-today`

### Services

Ambassador Edge Stack routes traffic to a service. A service is defined as `[scheme://]service[.namespace][:port]`. Everything except for the service is optional.

* `scheme` can be either `http` or `https`; if not present, the default is `http`.
* `service` is the name of a service (typically the service name in Kubernetes or Consul); it is not allowed to contain the `.` character.
* `namespace` is the namespace in which the service is running. Starting with Ambassador Edge Stack 1.0.0, if not supplied, it defaults to the namespace in which the Mapping resource is defined. The default behavior can be configured using the [the-module-resource.md](../../technical-reference/using-custom-resources/the-module-resource.md "mention"). When using a Consul resolver, `namespace` is not allowed.
* `port` is the port to which a request should be sent. If not specified, it defaults to `80` when the scheme is `http` or `443` when the scheme is `https`. Note that the resolver may return a port in which case the `port` setting is ignored. See [service-discovery-and-resolvers.md](../../technical-reference/ingress-and-load-balancing/service-discovery-and-resolvers.md "mention") for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
While using `service.namespace.svc.cluster.local` may work for Kubernetes resolvers, the preferred syntax is `service.namespace`.
{% endhint %}

### Extending Mappings

Mapping resources support a rich set of annotations to customize the specific routing behavior. Here's an example service for implementing the [CQRS pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) (using HTTP):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind:  Mapping
metadata:
  name:  cqrs-get
spec:
  prefix: /cqrs/
  method: GET
  service: getcqrs
  hostname: '*'
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind:  Mapping
metadata:
  name:  cqrs-put
spec:
  prefix: /cqrs/
  method: PUT
  service: putcqrs
  hostname: '*'
```

### Best Practices

Ambassador Edge Stack's configuration is assembled from multiple YAML blocks which are managed by independent application teams. This implies that certain best practices should be followed.

**Ambassador Edge Stack's configuration should be under version control.**

While you can always read back the Ambassador Edge Stack's configuration from Kubernetes or its diagnostic service, the Ambassador Edge Stack will not do versioning for you.

**Ambassador Edge Stack tries to not start with a broken configuration, but it's not perfect.**

Gross errors will result in the Ambassador Edge Stack refusing to start, in which case `kubectl logs` will be helpful. However, it's always possible to map a resource to the wrong service, or use the wrong `rewrite` rules. Ambassador Edge Stack can't detect that on its own, although its diagnostic service can help you figure it out.

**Be careful of mapping collisions.**

If two different developers try to map `/myservice/` to something, this can lead to unexpected behavior. Ambassador Edge Stack's canary deployment logic means that it's more likely that traffic will be split between them than that it will throw an error -- again, the diagnostic service can help you here. See [canary-releases.md](../../technical-reference/ingress-and-load-balancing/canary-releases.md "mention") for more information.

**Unless specified, mapping attributes cannot be applied to any other resource type.**
