# User Management

When you create an account, Blackbird automatically creates an organization for you. Then, you can manage your organization and invite team members to collaborate on your API projects.

Enterprise customers can also use this guide to integrate single sign-on (SSO).

## Managing an Organization

To manage your Blackbird organization:

1. Open the [Blackbird UI](https://blackbird.a8r.io/dashboard).
2. In the left pane, choose **Settings** and then **Organizations**.
3. Use the following tabs to manage your organization details:
   * **General:** View your organization details, including the numbers of APIs, instances, and members. You can also edit the name of your organization.
   * **Subscription:** View your subscription details or upgrade to access additional features. For information on Blackbird subscriptions and pricing, see [Blackbird Pricing](https://www.getambassador.io/blackbird-pricing). You can manage billing information, view your invoices, or cancel your plan by accessing the Stripe Billing portal in the **Manage or Cancel Plan** banner.
   * **Billing History:** View your subscription transactions. You can also choose the **View** icon under **Actions** to navigate to Stripe Billing. There, you can download your invoice or receipt for your records.

## Inviting Members

To invite members to your Blackbird organization:

1. Open the [Blackbird UI](https://blackbird.a8r.io/dashboard).
2. In the left pane, choose **Settings** and then **Users**.
3. Choose the **Invite Members** button.
4. In the **Invite Members** modal, copy the invitation link and send it to your teammates.

After your teammates choose the link, they can follow the prompts to create an account and start collaborating with you and your organization.

## Joining an Organization

If you want to join an organization, request an invitation link from the organization owner. After you receive the link, follow the prompts to create an account and start collaborating with your organization.

**Note:** You can join more than one organization.

## Integrating Single Sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) allows you to access Blackbird with a single set of credentials. By integrating SSO, you can streamline authentication, enhance your user experience, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access. It also simplifies account management for IT teams, making it easier to enforce security policies and manage user access.

To get started, enterprise customers can contact our [support team](mailto:support@datawire.io) with the following details based on your identity provider:

* **SAML:** SAML certificate and login URL
* **OIDC:** Client ID and Client Secret

Our team will guide you through the setup process and provide any additional instructions as needed.
