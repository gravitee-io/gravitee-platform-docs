Blackbird provides flexible tools for designing, implementing, and testing your API, whether you prefer a user interface or command line. Use the following graphic to learn about the differences.

## Blackbird UI

The Blackbird UI offers a user-friendly interface to help you:

* Create and manage API specifications.
* Create and manage mock instances for testing.
* Edit your API manually or with AI-powered assistance.
* View your mock, deployment, code run, and code debug instances.
* Manage your users and organizations.

To get started, visit the [Blackbird UI](https://blackbird.a8r.io/dashboard).

## Blackbird CLI

For users who prefer working from the command line, the Blackbird CLI allows you to:

* Create a new API or upload an existing API spec.
* Run your API spec code.
* Debug your API spec code.
* Create and manage mock instances.
* Connect to Kubernetes clusters to develop and test locally.
* Deploy APIs to secure, non-production environments.
* Enhance security by managing API instances with secure keys.
