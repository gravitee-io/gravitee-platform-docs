# Release Notes

## July 02, 2025

* **New release note tracking method**\
  Blackbird release notes are now organized by release date rather than version number. We'll continue to include the latest CLI version in our release notes for your reference.
* **Streamline your Blackbird workflow with the Blackbird MCP server**\
  You can now add the Blackbird MCP server to your IDE. This allows you to query Blackbird instances, upload new API specifications, create mock instances, and complete other tasks directly from your preferred AI chatbot.
* **View progress when generating a new API specification**\
  When you generate API specifications based on your code, a progress bar now appears in the lower-right corner of the Blackbird UI. The bar shows both the percentage complete and the current step in the process.
* **Access your project from notification messages**\
  When you generate API specifications based on your code, you can access the related project from the notification bell in the top-right corner by hovering over the “Completed indexing repository” message.
* **Blackbird CLI version 1.14.2 is now available**\
  This Blackbird CLI release includes internal changes that don't affect the functionality for end users.

***

## Version 1.14.1 (June 25, 2025)

* **Define additional GitHub details for API discovery and generation**\
  You can now specify the GitHub owner/organization, repository, and branch when discovering or generating API specifications with Blackbird.

  The Projects page now includes a job event log that displays real-time updates from the streaming service for in-progress jobs.
* **Access your Blackbird notifications**\
  The Blackbird UI now includes a notification bell in the top-right corner to display real-time status updates across all jobs and system activity.

## Version 1.14.0 (June 18, 2025)

* **Manage your MCP deployments using the Blackbird CLI**\
  You can now host and manage third-party MCP servers directly from the Blackbird CLI.
* **Host a third-party MCP server using VS Code**\
  You can now browse the MCP catalog and host a third-party MCP server in Blackbird using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Version 1.13.7 (June 17, 2025)

* **Create projects from your GitHub repositories**\
  You can now create projects based on your GitHub repositories. A project is built from a specific repository and includes one or more API definitions that you choose. Blackbird keeps the imported definitions up to date with changes made in the repository, so your definitions stay current as your APIs evolve. The sync only works one way, so changes made in Blackbird won’t update your GitHub repository.
* **Generate API specifications from your code**\
  You can now scan a GitHub repository for code related to API definitions and generate an OpenAPI specification from it.
* **Explore tutorials using the new Blackbird Demo Center**\
  You can now browse tutorials directly in the Blackbird UI to help you learn about key features and workflows.

***

## Version 1.13.4 (June 05, 2025)

* **Automatically install the Blackbird CLI with the VS Code extension**\
  The Hosted Dev Environment with Blackbird extension now automatically installs the latest version of the Blackbird CLI if it's not detected on your system.
* **Specify a custom Docker image name during deployments**\
  You can now specify a custom Docker image name when creating a deployment.
* **Specify a port during deployments**\
  You can now specify a port for the container to listen on when creating or updating a deployment.
