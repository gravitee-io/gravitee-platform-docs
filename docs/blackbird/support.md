# Support

We understand that building and managing APIs can be complex, and our team is ready to assist you.

## For paying customers

As a paying customer, you have access to our dedicated support team.

## For free trial customers

We’re excited that you’re exploring Blackbird! While direct access to our support team isn’t available during the free trial, we offer a variety of resources to help you get started. Our documentation covers everything from getting started to advanced features to guide you through your API development journey. You can also join our [Ambassador Community](https://datawire-oss.slack.com/signup) on Slack, where you can collaborate with other Blackbird users and connect with our team.
