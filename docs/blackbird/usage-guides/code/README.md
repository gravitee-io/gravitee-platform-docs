# Code

Blackbird provides multiple ways for you to quickly spin up code for your API specification and start testing and debugging.

* [code-generation.md](code-generation.md "mention"): Speed up your API development by converting your API specification into boilerplate code to help you get started. Blackbird currently creates Go projects using templates.
* [code-run-and-debug.md](code-run-and-debug.md "mention"): Inspect and troubleshoot your API specification in real time in a dedicated Blackbird environment using production-like traffic.
* [remote-clusters-telepresence](remote-clusters-telepresence/ "mention"): Run and debug your API specification locally while seamlessly interacting with the rest of your Kubernetes cluster. You can also intercept traffic to your service, routing requests from the cluster to your local machine as if were running remotely.
