# Using Headless Authentication in the Blackbird CLI

Headless authentication allows you to use the CLI without interactively signing in with a username and password. Instead, you generate and use a pre-authenticated credential called a token to securely log in. This method is especially beneficial when using the CLI in headless environments, like continuous integration (CI) pipelines, where automated, non-interactive logins are essential.

When you use a headless token, all actions executed with the CLI will be associated to the account used to generate the token. If a user belongs to multiple organizations, the token will act on the organization that was active when the token was created.

> **Note:** For details on the commands related to headless authentication tokens, see the [blackbird-cli](blackbird-cli/ "mention").

**To use headless authentication:**

1.  Generate a headless token.

    ```shell
    blackbird token create "ci-token"
    ```
2. Set the `BLACKBIRD_TOKEN` variable to the token value that was generated.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="GNU/Linux amd64" %}
```shell
export BLACKBIRD_TOKEN="<TOKEN GENERATED BY THE CLI>"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GNU/Linux arm64" %}
```shell
export BLACKBIRD_TOKEN="<TOKEN GENERATED BY THE CLI>"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS Intel (amd64)" %}
```shell
export BLACKBIRD_TOKEN="<TOKEN GENERATED BY THE CLI>"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS M Series (arm64)" %}
```shell
export BLACKBIRD_TOKEN="<TOKEN GENERATED BY THE CLI>"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
```powershell
$env:BLACKBIRD_TOKEN="<TOKEN GENERATED BY THE CLI>"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

After you create the token, you can run any Blackbird command.
