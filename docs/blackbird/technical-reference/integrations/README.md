# Integrations

Blackbird integrates with the following tools in your API development lifecycle to enhance workflow efficiency:

* [git.md](git.md "mention") – Import your OpenAPI specifications from GitHub to manage them seamlessly in Blackbird. Automatic syncs ensure your API resources stay up to date with changes in your repository.
* [visual-studio-code.md](visual-studio-code.md "mention") – Manage your resources, interact with APIs, and monitor your organization's subscription status directly from your editor.
* [slack.md](slack.md "mention") – Receive real-time mock and deployment notifications directly in your Slack workspace. Automated messages keep you and your team informed when a mock or deployment begins and completes.
