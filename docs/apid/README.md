# Introduction to Gravitee API Designer (APID)

Gravitee API Designer (APID), a Gravitee Cockpit offering, employs a no-code graphical interface and [Design First](https://www.gravitee.io/blog/why-design-first-when-building-apis) approach to quickly create APIs that are fully [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)-compliant.

Developed to accelerate business-driven innovation, Gravitee API Designer:

* Shifts the focus of API development from technical details to customer needs
* Empowers users to own API design and customization
* Embraces a quick feedback loop to improve the quality of APIs
