# Upgrading your trial to a customer account

During you trial period, you can upgrade to a paid enterprise account of Gravitee Cloud. With a paid enterprise account, you have direct access to three preconfigured environments in a highly available API Management Control Plane, and you can choose how to deploy and run API Gateways.

All Gravitee Cloud paid tiers come with consumption based plans. These plans are suited to fit your needs regardless of how many API requests or how many APIs you want to manage within your Gravitee Cloud account.

You must contact Gravitee to upgrade your account. To contact Gravitee, go to the [Contact Us](https://www.gravitee.io/contact-us-cockpit).
