# Cloud Hosted Gateways

## Introduction

A full SaaS set up of Gravitee is a convenient way of running Gravitee. Gravitee manages operations related to your environments for both the Control Plane and all gateways. Deploying Cloud hosted gateways has the following benefits:

* **Automatic Configuration & Scaling**: Gravitee automatically configures and scales gateways in high availability setups, delivering the compute power and resources needed based on your subscription tier.
* **Managed Upgrades**: Gravitee provides automatic patch upgrades, with self-serve feature upgrades available for enhanced control.
* **Dedicated Environments**: Each Cloud hosted gateway is dedicated to an API Management environment of your choice (e.g., Production, Test, Development), ensuring isolation and security across environments.

## Deploying a Cloud hosted gateway

This section shows you how to connect a Cloud hosted gateway to your Gravitee Cloud API Management control plane environments.

You may deploy one Cloud hosted gateway for each environment. Dont worry about scaling and high availability, Gravitee will take of that.

* Environment dedicated Cloud hosted gateways are deployed even if you select more than one environment. Cloud hosted gateways are never shared between your environments.
* Deploying a Cloud hosted gateway will take around 5 minutes.
