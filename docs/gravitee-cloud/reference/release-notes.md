#### Cloud Hosted Gateways

We’re thrilled to introduce **Cloud Hosted Gateways** for Gravitee Cloud API Management! With Cloud Hosted Gateways, Gravitee takes care of the setup and maintenance for your gateway environments, allowing you to focus on managing your APIs effortlessly.

**Key benefits include:**

* **Automatic Configuration & Scaling**: Gravitee automatically configures and scales gateways in high availability setups, delivering the compute power and resources needed based on your subscription tier.
* **Managed Upgrades**: Gravitee provides automatic patch upgrades, with self-serve feature upgrades available for enhanced control.
* **Dedicated Environments**: Each Cloud hosted gateway is dedicated to an API Management environment of your choice (e.g., Production, Test, Development), ensuring isolation and security across environments.

Deploying a Cloud Hosted Gateway takes just a few minutes. Simply navigate to your Gravitee Cloud Dashboard, select your environment to deploy Cloud hosted gateways for, and Gravitee will handle the rest!
