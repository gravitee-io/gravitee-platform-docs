# WebSocket

## Configuration

If you chose **WebSocket** as an entrypoint, you will be brought to a page where you can configure:

1. **Publisher configuration:** Choose to either enable or disable the publication capability by toggling **Enable the publication capability** ON or OFF. Disabling it assumes that the application will never publish any message.
2. **Subscriber configuration:** Choose to enable or disable the subscription capability by toggling **Enable the subscription capability** ON or OFF. Disabling it assumes that the application will never receive any message.
3. **Quality of service:** Use the drop-down menu to choose between the available options. QoS compatibility is detailed [here](docs/apim/4.4/using-the-product/managing-your-apis-with-gravitee-api-management/configuring-apis-with-the-gravitee-api-management/v4-api-configuration/quality-of-service.md).
