# Install on Amazon

There are three methods for installing Gravitee API Management (APIM) on an Amazon instance. Following the [quick install guide](quick-install.md) will install all prerequisites and the full APIM stack at the same time. The other two methods involve the [manual installation of prerequisites](manual-install/prerequisites.md), after which you can elect to [install all the APIM components individually](manual-install/apim-components-installation.md) or [install the full APIM stack](manual-install/apim-full-stack-installation.md).
