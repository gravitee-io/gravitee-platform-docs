From here, you can:

* Alter existing entrypoints by changing the context path
* Add a new entrypoint by clicking **Add context path** and then adding a new context path
* Delete existing entrypoints by clicking the <img src="broken-reference" alt="" data-size="line"> icon associated with the entrypoint that you want to delete
* Choose to enable or disable virtual hosts. Enabling virtual hosts requires you to define your virtual host and optionally enable override access.

When you are done, make sure to redeploy the API for your changes to take effect.
