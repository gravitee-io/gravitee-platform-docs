# API Configuration

## Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
In Gravitee 4.2, the API Management Console cannot be used to configure a TCP proxy API. To configure TCP proxy APIs, you must use the Management API and curl commands.
{% endhint %}

After you've created your APIs, you can further configure them using both the Gravitee API definition and the Gravitee APIM Console. This section focuses on how to configure APIs using the APIM Console.

API configuration differs slightly for v2 and v4 APIs. We have split this section into two main components to mirror this difference:

* [v4 API configuration](v4-api-configuration/README.md)
* [v2 API configuration](v2-api-configuration/README.md)
