# Plugins and API definitions

You can use plugins to expand the capabilities of your Gravitee API Management (APIM) environment. Also a Gravitee API definition is a JSON representation of everything that the APIM Gateway needs to know for it to proxy, apply policies to, and to create plans for your APIs and their traffic. For more information about plugins and Gravitee API definitions, see the following articles:
