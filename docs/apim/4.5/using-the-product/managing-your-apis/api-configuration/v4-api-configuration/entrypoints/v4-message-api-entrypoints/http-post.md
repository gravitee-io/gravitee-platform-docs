# HTTP POST

## Configuration

If you chose **HTTP POST** as an entrypoint, you will be brought to a page where you can configure:

1. **HTTP POST permissions:** Allow or disallow add request Headers to the generated message by toggling **Allow add request Headers to the generated message** ON or OFF.
2. **Quality of service:** Use the drop-down menu to choose between the available options. QoS compatibility is detailed [here](docs/apim/4.5/using-the-product/managing-your-apis/api-configuration/v4-api-configuration/quality-of-service.md).
