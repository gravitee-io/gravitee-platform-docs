# Publishing your API with the Gravitee Developer Portal

### Access API

First, we need to open the API in the APIM Console. You may already have it open from the previous part of the Quickstart Guide. If not, head back over to the **APIs** homescreen and select the API you created.

> * [x] Select **APIs** in the sidebar
> * [x] Select the API you created in Gateway APIs 101

### Publish API

This will take you straight to your API's **General Info** page. In the **Danger Zone**, we can update the visibility of the API:

* **Publish/Unpublish the API:** This is a toggle that controls the visibility of the API in the Developer Portal. Unless the API is also public, it is only visible to members of the API, which is controlled through **User and group access** in the inner sidebar.
* **Make Public/Private:** This is a toggle that makes the API visible to anyone with access to the Developer Portal. Note, this toggle only has an impact if the API is published.

> * [x] Click **Publish the API**, then **Publish** in the modal to add the API to the Developer Portal
> * [x] Click **Make Public**, then **Make Public** again in the modal, to make the API visible to all API consumers
