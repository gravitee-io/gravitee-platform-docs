# Adding a policy chain

1. Navigate to the light version of the Gravitee policy studio,
2. In the policy chain, click the **plus symbol**. You see a list of policies filtered to those are compatible with the phase the shared policy group executes on.
3. Add the policies to the chain, and then configure the policies.
4. To persist the changes, click **Save**.
5. To deploy the shared policy group to the gateway, click **Deploy.**

You can now use the shared policy group in an API flow.
