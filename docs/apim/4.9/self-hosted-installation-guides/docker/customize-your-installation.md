---

# Customize your Installation

## Install additional plugins

* To add an additional plugin, copy the plugin archive that is contained in a `.zip` folder into the `plugins-ext` folder.
  * For the API Gateway, `the plugin-ext` folder is located at `/gravitee/apim-gateway/plugins`.
  * For the Management API, the `plugin-ext` is located at `/gravitee/apim-management-api/plugins.`
* You can download additional plugins from [the plugins download page](https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-apim/plugins/).
* For more information about plugin deployment, see [Deployment](../../plugins/deployment.md#deployment).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some plugins need to be installed on both the API Gateway and the Management API. Installation details are provided in a specific plugin’s documentation.
{% endhint %}

## Use Redis as the datastore for rate-limiting counters

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Use Redis with docker-compose" %}
To use Redis with `docker compose`, complete the following steps:

1.  In the `$services.gateway.environment` section of the Docker Compose file, add the following lines of code:\


    ```yaml
          - gravitee_ratelimit_type=redis
          - gravitee_ratelimit_redis_host=gravitee-redis
          - gravitee_ratelimit_redis_port=6379
    ```



    {% hint style="info" %}
    Your Redis host and port may be different
    {% endhint %}
2. Remove the following line of code: `gravitee_ratelimit_mongodb_uri`.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Use Redis with Docker images" %}
To use Redis with Docker images, complete the following steps:

1.  In the command that you use to start the API Gateway, add the following environment variables:\


    ```bash
      --env gravitee_ratelimit_type=redis \
      --env gravitee_ratelimit_redis_host=gravitee-redis \
      --env gravitee_ratelimit_redis_port=6379 \
    ```



    {% hint style="info" %}
    Your Redis host and port may be different.
    {% endhint %}
2. Remove the following line of code: `gravitee_ratelimit_mongodb_uri`.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Use the JDBC connection as the datastore for management

### Prerequisites

* The correct JDBC driver must be installed on the API Gateway and the Management API.
* The containers must be started using additional environment variables.

### 1. Download the driver

To download the driver, complete the following sub-steps:

1. Download the correct driver for your database. For more information about downloading the correct drive, go to [Supported databases.](../../prepare-a-production-environment/repositories/#supported-databases)
2. Place the driver in the `plugins-ext` folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
* For the API Gateway, the `plugin-ext` folder is located at `/gravitee/apim-gateway/plugins`.
* For the Management API, the `plugin-ext`folder is located at the `/gravitee/apim-management-api/plugins`.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Use JDBC

To use the JDBC driver, complete the following sub-steps based on if you installed Gravitee APIM using docker-compose or if you installed Gravitee APIM using Docker images.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Use JDBC with docker-compose" %}
To use JDBC with `docker-compose`, complete the following steps:

1.  In the `$services.gateway.environment` section, add the following lines of code:\


    ```yaml
     - gravitee_management_type=jdbc
     - gravitee_management_jdbc_url=jdbc:mysql://gravitee-mysql:3306/gravitee?useSSL=false&user=mysql_users&password=mysql_password
    ```



    {% hint style="danger" %}
    * Ensure that your `gravitee_management_jdbc_url` is appropriate for your environment.
    * Use `useSSL=false` with caution in production.
    * Your host, port, username, and password may be different.
    {% endhint %}
2. Remove the following line of code: `gravitee_management_mongodb_uri`.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Use JDBC with Docker images" %}
To use JDBC with Docker images, complete the following steps:

1.  In the command that you use to start the Gateway, add the following environment variables:\


    ```bash
    --env gravitee_management_type=jdbc \
      --env gravitee_management_jdbc_url=jdbc:mysql://gravitee-mysql:3306/gravitee?useSSL=false&user=mysql_users&password=mysql_password \
    ```



    {% hint style="danger" %}
    * Ensure that your`gravitee_management_jdbc_url` is appropriate for your environment.
    * Use `useSSL=false` with caution in production.
    * Your host, port, username, and password may be different.
    {% endhint %}
2. Remove the following line of code: `gravitee_management_mongodb_uri`.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
