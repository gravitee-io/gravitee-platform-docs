To upgrade your RPM installation, choose the upgrade process depending on your installation:

* Upgrade the full APIM stack (includes all components)
* Upgrade components one-by-one

## Prerequisites

### Backup Configuration Files

The following configuration files will be overwritten during the RPM upgrade process. You must back them up before proceeding:

* `gravitee.yml`  or your single configuration file if everything is consolidated
* `constants.json`
* `config.json`  for the Developer Portal
* `conf.d`  NGINX configuration directory

{% hint style="danger" %}
Failure to backup these files will result in loss of your custom configurations.

### Java Version Requirement

Starting in version 4.7, Gravitee APIM requires **Java 21**. If you are deploying APIM with RPM or using the distribution bundle, please ensure you upgrade your Java version before proceeding with the APIM upgrade.

## Upgrade the full APIM stack

```bash
sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-apim-4x
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart graviteeio-apim-gateway graviteeio-apim-rest-api nginx
```
