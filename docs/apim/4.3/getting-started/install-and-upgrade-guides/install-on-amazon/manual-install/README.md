# Manual install

Manual installation requires you to refer to the prerequisites page, which walks through all the prerequisites required to install Gravitee API Management (APIM) on an Amazon instance. Once completed, you can elect to [install all the APIM components individually](apim-components-installation.md) or [install the full APIM stack](docs/apim/4.3/getting-started/install-and-upgrade-guides/install-on-red-hat-and-centos/apim-full-stack-installation.md).

Alternatively, follow the [quick install guide](docs/apim/4.3/getting-started/install-and-upgrade-guides/installing-a-self-hosted-gravitee-api-management-platform/install-on-amazon/quick-install.md) to install all prerequisites and the full APIM stack at the same time.
