# Plans

## Introduction

A **plan** provides a service and access layer on top of your API that specifies access limits, subscription validation modes, and other configurations to tailor it to an application. To expose your Kafka API to internal or external consumers, it must have at least one plan. Gravitee offers the following types of plans for Kafka APIs:&#x20;

* **Keyless.** For more information about the keyless plan, see [keyless.md](../expose-apis/plans/keyless.md "mention").
* **API Key.** For more information about the API Key plan, see [api-key.md](../expose-apis/plans/api-key.md "mention").
* **OAuth2.** For more information about the OAuth2 plan, see [oauth2.md](../expose-apis/plans/oauth2.md "mention").
* **JWT.** For more information about the JWT plan, see [jwt.md](../expose-apis/plans/jwt.md "mention").

mTLS plans are not yet supported for Kafka APIs.

For Kafka APIs, these plans correspond directly to Kafka authentication methods:

<table><thead><tr><th width="201">Plan</th><th>Corresponding Kafka Authentication</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Keyless (public)</td><td>PLAINTEXT</td></tr><tr><td>API Key</td><td>The API key is used as the password, and the md5 hash of the API key is used as the username, as part of the SASL/SSL with SASL PLAIN authentication method.</td></tr><tr><td>JWT</td><td>Equivalent to SASL/SSL with SASL OAUTHBEARER authentication, where the JWT is used as the OAuth token.</td></tr><tr><td>OAuth2</td><td>Equivalent to SASL/SSL with SASL OAUTHBEARER authentication.</td></tr></tbody></table>

To authenticate users, each plan must include at least one security type. A security type is a policy that is integrated directly into a plan. Once a plan is created, the security type cannot be changed. Also, your Kafka APIs cannot have conflicting authentication. For example, If your Kafka API has the Keyless plan, you must have Keyless authentication. However, you can use policies to add additional security at the API or plan level.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You cannot have multiple published plans with conflicting authentication. For example, you cannot have a Keyless plan and a JWT plan for a Kafka API. However, you can have multiple plans with authentication for a Kafka API. For example, OAuth and JWT.&#x20;

## Plan stages

A plan can exist in one of four stages:&#x20;

* STAGING. This is the draft mode of a plan, where it can be configured but won’t be accessible to users.
* PUBLISHED. API consumers can view a published plan on the Developer Portal. Once subscribed, they can use it to consume the API. A published plan can still be edited.
* DEPRECATED. A deprecated plan won’t be available on the Developer Portal and API consumers won’t be able to subscribe to it. This cannot be undone. Existing subscriptions are not impacted, giving current API consumers time to migrate without breaking their application.&#x20;
* CLOSED. Once a plan is closed, all associated subscriptions are closed. API consumers subscribed to this plan won’t be able to use the API. This cannot be undone.

Depending on the stage it's in, a plan can be edited, published, deprecated, or closed. See [this](configure-kafka-apis/consumers.md#plans) documentation for specific instructions.

### Edit a plan

To edit a plan, click on the pencil icon:

### Publish a plan

To publish a plan, click on the icon of a cloud with an arrow:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/plan_publish.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Publish a plan</p></figcaption></figure>

Once a plan has been published, it must be redeployed.

### Deprecate a plan

To deprecate a plan, click on the icon of a cloud with an 'x':

### Close a plan

To close a plan, click on the 'x' icon:

## Plan selection rules

Unlike with HTTP APIs, there is only ever one set of policies per plan. Once the plan is defined, you can add one set of policies on that plan, but you can only remove it or edit it. The plan is selected based on the credential defined by the client in their connection properties.
