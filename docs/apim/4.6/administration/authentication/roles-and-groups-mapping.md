# Roles and Groups Mapping

Now that you have configured your chosen Identity Provider(s) in Gravitee API Management, you may want to start automatically mapping these user accounts into specific roles and groups within Gravitee.

After adding your Identity Provider, two new items will appear within your Identity Provider configuration; **Groups Mapping** and **Roles Mapping** (as shown below).
