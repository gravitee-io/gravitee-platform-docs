# User and Group Access

## Overview

The **User and group access** section allows you to manage user and group access to individual applications via the following headers:

* [Members](user-and-group-access.md#members)
* [Groups](user-and-group-access.md#groups)
* [Transfer ownership](user-and-group-access.md#transfer-ownership)

## Members

Under the **Members** tab you can add users or groups as members of you application and define their roles to manage and perform tasks and operations.

* Click **+ Add members** to add members to your application. You can search for users by name or email.
* Use the **Role** drop-down menu to select member roles, which grant specific permissions. For more information on roles, please refer to the [documentation](../../administration/user-management.md#roles).

## Groups

Click the **Groups** tab to see which groups have access to your application. Use the drop-down menu to change group selections.

Selecting a group gives all members of that group access to your application.

## Transfer ownership

Under the **Transfer ownership** tab you can grant complete application access to an application member or other user.

Click **Application member** and use the drop-down menu to select a user who is already a member of your application.

Click **Other user** to search for someone who is not a member of your application. You can enter either their name or email into the search field. Once you've selected a new primary owner for your application, use the drop-down to assign their role.
