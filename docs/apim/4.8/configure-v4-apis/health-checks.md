    * **Inherit configuration:** Choose whether to inherit the health-check service configuration from the endpoint group.
    * Toggle **Enabled** to ON to enable the health-check service, which requires that the API has been deployed.&#x20;
    * **Schedule:** Use a CRON expression to schedule the health-check.
    * **HTTP Method:** Specify the HTTP method to invoke the request.
    * **Target:** Specify the path or complete URL on which to run the health-check. By default, the path is appended to the endpoint's path.&#x20;
    * Toggle **Override endpoint path** to ON to override the path defined on the endpoint. If toggled OFF, the path will be appended to the endpoint path.
    * **HTTP Headers:** Use the **Add** button to specify the HTTP headers to add to the health-check request.
    * **Assertion:** Specify the Expression Language expression that will be evaluated by the health-check.
    * **Success threshold:** Specify the number of consecutive positive assertions that will identify the backend service as available.
    * **Failure threshold:** Specify the number of consecutive negative assertions that will identify the backend service as unavailable.
