# Subscriptions

## Introduction

In Gravitee API Management, a subscription is the mechanism by which an API publisher controls who can use their API, under what conditions, and with what level of access. API publishers can define policies for approving or rejecting subscription requests to ensure that only authorized consumers can interact with their APIs. API publishers can then refer to subscriptions to track usage metrics, including consumption volume and performance.

Subscriptions can be created, approved, suspended, or revoked, depending on the API consumer’s needs or policy violations. Initially, an API consumer (such as a developer, application, or team) creates a subscription to request access to an API that's managed within Gravitee. During the subscription process, the consumer must select the API [plan](plans/) they wish to subscribe to. The plans for an API were predefined by the API publisher to set up access criteria and implement usage restrictions, such as rate limits and quotas.

After choosing a plan, a consumer selects an [application](applications/) to use with the subscription. The application contains information about the user, some of which may be required by the plan. When a subscription is approved, a consumer can use their application credentials to consume the API. In addition to basic types of authentication, Gravitee supports built-in API key management and integration with identity providers (including Gravitee’s own[ Access Management](https://www.gravitee.io/platform/access-management)) for OAuth and JWT support.

## Configuration

From a configuration perspective, a subscription is a successful contract between an API publisher and an API consumer. A subscription is created when an API consumer uses a registered application to make a subscription request to a published plan and an API publisher either manually or automatically validates the subscription.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Keyless plan subscriptions**

APIs with Keyless plans do not require the API consumer to create an application or submit a subscription request because no authorization is required to access the backend API.
{% endhint %}

This page includes the following sections:

* [Subscription requests](subscriptions.md#subscription-requests)
* [Manage subscriptions](subscriptions.md#manage-subscriptions)
* [Transfer subscriptions](subscriptions.md#transfer-subscriptions)

## Subscription requests

API consumers can subscribe to APIs with published plans during the application creation process, or after the application is created, through the APIM Console or Developer Portal.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Whether an application has an associated `client_id` depends on how it was configured. To subscribe to OAuth2 or JWT plans, the application must have a `client_id`.
{% endhint %}

To subscribe to an API via the APIM Console:

1. Log in to your APIM Console
2. Select **Applications** from the left nav
3. Select **Subscriptions** from the inner left nav
4.  Click the **+ Create a subscription** button&#x20;

5. Search for the API you want to subscribe to. To be searchable the API consumer must have access to the API, i.e., the API must be public or the API consumer must be a member of it.&#x20;
6.  Select the plan you would like to request a subscription to&#x20;

7. Click **Create** to see the subscription details

## Manage subscriptions

When creating a plan, you can enable subscription auto-validation to immediately approve subscription requests. If **Auto validate subscription** is disabled, the API publisher must approve all subscription requests.

{% hint style="info" %}
To be notified of subscription validation tasks, enable [Notifications](../gravitee-gateway/notifications.md)
{% endhint %}

To manage subscriptions in APIM Console:

1. Log in to your APIM Console
2. Select **APIs** from the left nav
3. Select the API with subscriptions to manage
4. Select **Consumers** from the inner left nav
5. Click the **Subscriptions** header tab
6. Select the request or subscription you want to manage
7. Validate or reject the subscription
   *   If validating, fill out the **Validate your subscription** form, then click **Validate**&#x20;

### API Key plans

Subscriptions to API Key plans include additional security management settings:

*   **Renew:** Generate a new API key or provide a custom API key. The existing API key will be automatically invalidated after two hours.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/subscription_api key renew.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Renew an API key</p></figcaption></figure>
*   **Revoke:** Immediately invalidate an existing API key. This option is reversible.&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/subscription_api key revoke.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Revoke an API key</p></figcaption></figure>
*   **Expire:** Set a date/time to automatically invalidate an existing API key&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/subscription_api key expire.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Expire an API key</p></figcaption></figure>

## Transfer subscriptions

API publishers can transfer active subscriptions to a new plan with the same security type:

1. Log in to your APIM Console
2. Select **APIs** from the left nav
3. Select the API with the subscription to transfer
4. Select **Consumers** from the inner left nav
5. Click the **Subscriptions** header tab
6. Click the pencil icon of the subscription you want to transfer
7.  At the bottom of the **Subscription details** section, click Transfer&#x20;

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/subscription_transfer.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Transfer a subscription</p></figcaption></figure>
8.  Select the plan to transfer the subscription to, then click **Transfer**&#x20;
