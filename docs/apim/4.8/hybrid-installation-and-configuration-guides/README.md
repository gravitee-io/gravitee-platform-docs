## Overview

Hybrid installations use a mix of self-hosted and cloud components to provide flexibility when defining your architecture and deployment. In a Gravitee hybrid installation, the Gravitee platform is split into two deployments that can be hosted independently but must communicate over a network.&#x20;

A typical Gravitee hybrid installation consists of a SaaS Control Plane and a self-hosted Data Plane. The Control Plane is a Cloud installation that is hosted by Gravitee. Gravitee currently supports both the Classic Cloud and Next-Gen Cloud. The Data Plane is a self-hosted installation that consists of the Gravitee Gateway, Redis, and, for Gravitee Classic Cloud, a log management solution.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Self-hosted software is installed and maintained by the customer and can run in any environment the customer controls, whether on-prem, in a private cloud, or even in a public cloud such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.
{% endhint %}

A hybrid installation combines the ease of operations of a Cloud-hosted control plane with the power and security of self-hosted Gateways to provide the following benefits:

* **Data Residency and Compliance.** You can keep sensitive data within your infrastructure. You can also ensure that data remains in the location where the resource owner resides, which helps you comply with data residency regulations.
* **Reduced latency**: By hosting the Gateway within your own infrastructure, API requests are processed closer to your services, which minimizes latency and enhances performance.
* **Full control over traffic**: All API traffic flows through your infrastructure, which provides you with complete control over routing, monitoring, and enforcing security policies - outside of the policies executed on the Gateway runtime.
* **Scalability and flexibility**: You have full control over the scaling of the Gateway.
* **Customization and integration**: Integrate with your existing infrastructure and customize the deployment to meet your organizationâ€™s specific security, monitoring, or logging requirements.
* **Security**: Sensitive API traffic does not need to leave your infrastructure, reducing exposure to potential threats and vulnerabilities. Additionally, you can enforce your organization's security measures directly, at the Data Plane level.

If you are using Gravitee Cloud, you can enable multi-tenancy. Gravitee multi-tenancy describes a configuration in which features and data are isolated between tenants. This allows you to register multiple APIM environments and installations, manage environment hierarchies, and promote APIs across higher and lower environments.&#x20;

## Classic Cloud vs Next-Gen Cloud

{% hint style="warning" %}
Classic Cloud will be deprecated once Next-Gen Cloud reaches full parity and a transition plan is established.
{% endhint %}

As the name implies, Next-Gen Cloud is the next generation of Gravitee Classic Cloud. Classic Cloud is currently more robust than Next-Gen Cloud, although Next-Gen Cloud will eventually reach full feature parity.

The following table indicates which Gravitee products are currently supported by each version of Gravitee Cloud.

<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th data-type="checkbox">Classic Cloud</th><th data-type="checkbox">Next-Gen Cloud</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>APIM</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Access Management (AM)</td><td>true</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Alert Engine (AE)</td><td>true</td><td>false</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Hybrid Gateway components

The tables below list the Data Plane and Control Plane components that are part of a Gravitee hybrid deployment.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To avoid updates to the Gateway configuration and redeployment, Redis, Logstash, and Fluentd should be configured prior to starting the Gateway.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

These components are configured differently depending on the deployment method. Each installation guide includes configurations for both the Gateway and Redis. Logstash and Fluentd configurations are also included for Classic Cloud installations.

## Architecture

Hybrid architecture refers to a scheme where certain Gravitee API Management components are Gravitee-managed SaaS components while others remain self-hosted by the user on-prem and/or in a private cloud. Gravitee Cloud and API Designer are optional Gravitee-managed components that can be connected to a hybrid API Management installation.

The following diagrams illustrate the component management, design, and self-hosted-to-SaaS connections of a hybrid architecture.
