## Prerequisites

Before you install a Hybrid Gateway, complete the following steps:

* Download Ensure that [Java 17 ](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)is available in the `$PATH`.
* Ensure that you have outbound internet access to Gravitee Cloud Gate (`eu.cloudgate.gravitee.io` or `us.cloudgate.gravitee.io`) over HTTPS (443).
* Install Redis required for rate limiting features. See [Redis Installation Guide](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/).
* Download the `.zip` binaries from [Gravitee.io Downloads](https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-apim/distributions/).
* Complete the steps in [#prepare-your-installation](./#prepare-your-installation "mention").

## Install Gravitee APIM

1.  Install the APIM Gateway using the following commands:

    ```sh
    unzip graviteeio-apim-gateway-latest.zip -d /opt/gravitee

    cd /opt/gravitee/graviteeio-apim-gateway-*
    ```
2. Configure the Gateway section of your `gravitee.yml` file:
   1.  To access your `gravitee.yml` file, use the following command:

       ```bash
       vi config/gravitee.yml
       ```
   2.  Use the following configuration in the Gateway section of `gravitee.yml`:

       ```yaml
       management:
         type: http

       cloud:
         token: <YOUR-CLOUD-TOKEN>

       ratelimit:
         type: none

       license:
         key: <YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>
       ```

       * Replace `<YOUR-CLOUD-TOKEN>` with your Cloud Token.&#x20;
       * Replace `<YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>` with your License Key.
3.  Start the Gateway using the following command:&#x20;

    ```bash
    ./bin/gravitee
    ```
4.  (Optional) To run the Gateway in the background, use the following command:&#x20;

    ```bash
    nohup ./bin/gravitee &
    ```

## Verification

*   To verify that the installation was successful, use the following command to confirm registration and `/sync` with Gravitee Cloud:

    ```bash
    tail -f logs/gravitee.log
    ```
