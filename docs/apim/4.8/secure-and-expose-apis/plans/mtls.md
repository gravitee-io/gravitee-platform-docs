# mTLS

## Overview

The mTLS authentication type enforces the use of a client certificate when connecting to an API. The client certificate is added to an application, after which a subscription is created for that application. At runtime, the Gateway checks for a match between the incoming request's client certificate and a certificate belonging to an application with an active subscription.

You can use mTLS with or without TLS enabled between the client and the Gateway. The Gateway server can require client authentication, which uses the server-level truststore to determine trusted clients. The mTLS plan then evaluates the client certificate with Gateway-level TLS, which exists in either of the following locations:

* The TLS session between the client and the Gateway.
* A pre-specified header in plaintext, base64-encoded format.&#x20;

Client authentication can occur if a load balancer is placed in front of the Gateway that terminates TLS.

## Limitations

Currently, mTLS plans have the following limitations:

* You can apply mTLS plans to only v4 APIs.
* You cannot use mTLS plans in Gravitee Cloud with SaaS-based Gateways.
* Only one client certificate can be added per application. This means that to rotate certificates for an application, you need to either pause the application’s subscriptions or schedule a maintenance window to avoid traffic for that API.&#x20;
* Applications do not provide a warning that certificates are going to expire.

## How it works

When using an mTLS plan, you do not need to manually define a Gateway truststore. The Gateway automatically retrieves all certificates from [Applications (that have a TLS Configuration)](mtls.md#how-to-add-a-client-certificate) and loads them into an in-memory truststore.

## Initial Gateway configuration

To use an mTLS plan, you need to [enable HTTPS on your Gateway(s)](../../prepare-a-production-environment/configure-your-http-server.md#enable-https-support). &#x20;

To enable HTTPS using the `values.yaml` file, use the following configuration to secure Gateway traffic and set the TLS client authentication option:

{% code title="Kubernetes values.yaml" %}
```yaml
gateway:
  # ... skipped for simplicity
  secured: true
  ssl:
    clientAuth: request # Supports none, request, required
    keystore:
      # ... skipped for simplicity
```
{% endcode %}

## How to add a client certificate

To subscribe to an mTLS plan, the client has to add a certificate to their application. To add a certificate to an application, complete the following steps:

1. In the Console, navigate to **Applications**, and then click a specific application.
2. Within the application, click the **Tls Configuration** setting. The client certificate is pasted in base64-encoded format.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Multiple applications in the same APIM instance may not share client certificates. You cannot save an application’s configuration if its client certificate is already associated with another application.
{% endhint %}

When a client certificate is added to an application, the Gateway adds the application to its in-memory truststore. At runtime, the Gateway checks if a certificate in the truststore matches the certificate of an application subscribed to the API.

## How to call an API&#x20;

To call an API with mTLS, use the following command:

* Replace `<client.cer>` with the name of the file containing your client certificate.
* Replace `<client.key>` with the name of the file containing the client key.

```bash
$ curl –-cert  <client.cer> --key <client.key> https://my-gateway.com/mtls-api
```

Both the client certificate and the private key are required to ensure that your client trusts the certificate sent by the Gateway.

## How to terminate TLS

{% hint style="danger" %}
Starting with Gravitee APIM 4.5, client certificates processed by NGINX can only be extracted from headers in plaintext.
{% endhint %}

You can use an mTLS plan when you run a load balancer like NGINX in front of the Gateway. TLS is terminated at the load balancer, and the load balancer forwards traffic to the Gateway in plaintext.

The following blocks configure the Gateway to use mTLS:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="gravitee.yaml" %}
{% code title="gravitee.yaml" %}
```yaml
http:
  # ...
  ssl:
    clientAuthHeader:
      name: X-Gravitee-Client-Cert
    # ...
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kubernetes values.yaml" %}
{% code title="values.yaml" %}
```yaml
gateway:
  # ...
  ssl:
    clientAuthHeader:
      name: X-Gravitee-Client-Cert
    # ...
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

When executing an mTLS plan, the Gateway checks if TLS is enabled.&#x20;

* If TLS is enabled, the Gateway uses the certificate from the TLS handshake. The handshake occurs before plan selection.&#x20;
* If TLS is not enabled, the Gateway checks for the certificate in the header. If the header contains a valid base64-encoded plaintext certificate matching a certificate for a subscribed application, the request succeed.

Ensure that only trusted parties can set the certificate header. If you are using a load balancer, the load balancer must be solely responsible for setting this header, and the Gateway should only be directly accessible through the load balancer.
