<summary>Nginx cannot open on ports 8084 and 8085</summary>

Sometimes, an SELinux configuration issue can prevent Nginx from opening on ports 8084 and 8085. To correct this issue, complete the following steps:

1. Validate that the port is not in the list of managed HTTP ports by running `semanage port -l`.  You should get the following output:

```sh
$ semanage port -l | grep http_port_t
http_port_t                tcp      80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000
```

2. Add the port for Nginx to bind to, for example, 8084, using the following command:

```sh
$ semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 8084
```

3. Validate that the port is listed using the following command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
$ semanage port -l | grep http_port_t
http_port_t                tcp      8084, 80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000

```
{% endcode %}

4. Restart Nginx.

<summary>Ports 8082 to 8085 port do not open with a firewall enabled</summary>

If you have a firewall enabled on your Operating System (OS), you must open the APIM port through the firewall.&#x20;

To open ports 8082 to 8085 through the firewall, use the following command:

```bash
 sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8082-8085/tcp
```
