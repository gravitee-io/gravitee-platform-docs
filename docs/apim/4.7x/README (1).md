# Introduction

Gravitee API Management (APIM) is a lightweight and performant management tool that accelerates and streamlines the governance and security of both synchronous and asynchronous APIs. It provides a centralized platform from which to measure and control API consumption, share and discover APIs, and manage the API lifecycle, versioning, and documentation.

As a highly flexible and scalable solution, Gravitee APIM integrates with a customer's infrastructure and conforms to specific business needs. APIM is fully extensible using its own internal plugin system where customers can define their own policies and develop their own reporting systems.
