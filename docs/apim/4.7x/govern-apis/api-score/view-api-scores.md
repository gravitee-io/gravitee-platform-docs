The **Overview** and **APIs** sections of the **API Score** page provide you with high-level metrics to understand the quality of your APIs. These metrics are:

* The average score of your API
* The number of errors in your API
* The number of warnings in your API

* The number of hints in your API

The **Overview** section shows these metrics across all of your APIs.

### Filter API Score issues

To filter your API's issues by category, select from the tabs of API Score metrics. By default, all issues are shown. If no information exists for a metric, it will be grayed out and you will not be able to select it.

You can also filter issues via the search function. You can search using information from the following columns:

* Severity
* Recommendation&#x20;
* Path

To filter using the search function, type your search query into the **Search** field. The table showing issue details is filtered as you type.

The table has the following columns:

* **Severity:** This gauges the severity of the issue. In order of increasing severity, the options are: hint, info, warning, error.
* **Line/Column:** The line and column of the issue location are shown in `[line]:[column]` format.&#x20;
* **Recommendation:** This column provides a recommendation for how to fix the issue.&#x20;
* **Path:** This column shows the path to the issue location.
