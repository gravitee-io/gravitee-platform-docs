## Overview

This guide explains how to install the Gravitee Hybrid Gateway using either the RPM package or ZIP archive. This installation type is suitable for Linux distributions and flexible deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before you install a Hybrid Gateway, complete the following steps:

* Ensure that Java 17 is available in the `$PATH`.
* Ensure that you have outbound internet access to Gravitee Cloud Gate (`eu.cloudgate.gravitee.io` or `us.cloudgate.gravitee.io`) over HTTPS (443).
* Install Redis.
* Complete the steps in [#prepare-your-installation](./#prepare-your-installation "mention").

## Install Gravitee APIM

1.  Install the RPM package using the following command. This installs the Gateway at `/opt/graviteeio-apim-gateway`.\


    ```bash
    sudo rpm -i https://download.gravitee.io/gateway/4.x/rpm/graviteeio-apim-gateway-latest.rpm
    ```


2. Configure the Gateway section of your `gravitee.yml` file:
   1.  To access your `gravitee.yml` file, use the following command:\


       ```bash
       sudo vi /opt/graviteeio-apim-gateway/config/gravitee.yml
       ```


   2.  Use the following configuration in the Gateway section of `gravitee.yml`:\


       ```yaml
       management:
         type: http

       cloud:
         token: <YOUR-CLOUD-TOKEN>

       ratelimit:
         type: none
          redis:
            host: localhost
            port: 6379

       license:
         key: <YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>
       ```



       * Replace `<YOUR-CLOUD-TOKEN>` with your Cloud Token.&#x20;
       * Replace `<YOUR-LICENSE-KEY>` with your License Key.\

3.  Start the Gateway using the following command: \


    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start graviteeio-apim-gateway
    ```


4.  (Optional) To enable the service on boot, use the following command: \


    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable graviteeio-apim-gateway
    ```

## Verification

To verify that the installation was successful, complete the following steps:

1.  &#x20;Open the logs for the installation using the following command:\


    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /opt/graviteeio-apim-gateway/logs/gravitee.log
    ```


2. Navigate to the `/sync` and `/reports` endpoints. If these endpoints have synced successfully, your installation is correct.
