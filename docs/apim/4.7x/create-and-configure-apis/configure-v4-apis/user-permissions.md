## Configure API user and group access

To configure user and group access for an API:

1. Log in to your APIM Console
2. Click on **APIs** in the left nav
3. Select your API
4. Click on **Configuration** in the inner left nav
5. Select the **User Permissions** tab

### Add members to an API

Click **+ Add members** to add members to your API or alter member roles, which grant specific permissions. For more information on roles, please refer to the [roles documentation.](../../configure-and-manage-the-platform/manage-organizations-and-environments/user-management.md#roles)

### Add groups to an API

To give groups access to your API, click **Manage groups** and select the desired group(s) from the drop-down menu. This will give all members of that group access to your API.

### Transfer API ownership

If you are the owner of the API, you can transfer ownership to another member, user, or group. Click **Transfer ownership**, then select **API member**, **Other user**, or **Primary owner group.** Next, define the stakeholder to which you want to transfer API ownership and assign that stakeholder a role.
