# API Key

## Overview

The API key authentication type enforces verification of API keys during request processing, allowing only applications with approved API keys to access an API. This plan type ensures that API keys are valid, i.e., not revoked or expired, and are approved to consume the specific resources associated with the API.

## Configuration

An API Key plan offers only basic security, acting more like a unique identifier than a security token.&#x20;

* **Propagate API Key to upstream API:** Toggle ON to ensure the request to the backend API includes the API key header sent by the API consumer. This is useful for backend APIs that already have integrated API key authentication.
* **Additional selection rule:** Allows you to use Gravitee Expression Language (EL) to filter plans of the same type by contextual data (request headers, tokens, attributes, etc.). For example, if there are multiple API key plans, you can set different selection rules on each plan to determine which plan handles each request.

## **API Key generation**

By default, API keys are randomly generated for each subscription, but Gravitee also offers custom API key generation and shared API key generation. Both of these settings can be enabled at the environment level:

1. Log in to your APIM Console
2. Select Settings from the left nav
3.  Select Settings from the inner left nav:&#x20;

### Custom API key

You can specify a custom API key for an API Key plan. This is particularly useful when you want to silently migrate to APIM and have a pre-defined API key. When prompted, you can choose to provide your custom API key or let APIM generate one for you by leaving the field empty.

The custom API key must have between 8 and 64 characters and be URL-compliant. `^ # % @ \ / ; = ? | ~ ,`and the 'space' character are invalid.

You can provide a custom API key when:

*   Creating a subscription&#x20;

* Accepting a subscription
*   Renewing a subscription&#x20;

### Shared API key

The shared API key mode allows consumers to reuse the same API key across all API subscriptions of an application. On their application's second subscription, the consumer is asked to choose between reusing their key across all subscriptions or generating one different API key for each subscription (default). This is known as the application API key type, which cannot be modified.

**Shared API key limitations**

API keys can only be shared across API Key plans that belong to distinct Gateway APIs. If you attempt to subscribe to two API Key plans on the same Gateway API, no prompt will be made to choose the application API key type and the default mode will be used automatically.

To select the API key type, the shared API key mode must be [enabled](api-key.md#api-key-plan) before creating an application. To enable this option, create a new application and subscribe to two API Key plans.

If shared API key mode is disabled, applications that have already been configured to use a shared key will continue to do so, but consumers will no longer be asked to choose between modes on their second subscription.

#### Modifying shared API keys

A shared API key may be used to call APIs that are owned by other API publishers. Consequently:

* Shared API keys cannot be edited from an API publisher's subscriptions
*   API publishers can read shared API keys, but cannot renew or revoke them&#x20;

*   Shared API keys can only be renewed/revoked by the application owner, from the subscription view of their APIM Console or Developer Portal&#x20;
