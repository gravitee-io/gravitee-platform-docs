# API Review and Quality

You can enable API review and quality to avoid public exposure to the Developer Portal that is unexpected and lacks strong security requirements, or if you want a member of a Quality team to review API designs prior to deploying the API and making it accessible to API consumers. This can seamlessly establish a robust API strategy.

You can find more information about API review and quality in the [API Quality](../../../api-analytics/api-quality.md) documentation.
