# Cache

## Overview

Caches are used to store different types of data in Gravitee API Management (APIM). The following Cache Managers are available as plugins:

* **Standalone Cache Manager:** The default plugin. The cache will not be distributed and will always remain local to the node (in-memory).
* **Hazelcast Cache Manager:** Must be added to the distribution and enabled by setting `cache.type` to `hazelcast`. The cache can be either local (in-memory) or distributed (Hazelcast IMap).&#x20;

## Configuration

{% hint style="warning" %}
The example below must be modified according to your installation context.
{% endhint %}

The following is an example of the Hazelcast implementation:

```xml
<cluster-name>gio-apim-distributed-cache</cluster-name>
<network>
    <port auto-increment="true" port-count="100">5701</port>
    <join>
        <auto-detection enabled="true"/>
        <multicast enabled="false"/>
        <tcp-ip enabled="true">
            <interface>127.0.0.1</interface>
        </tcp-ip>
    </join>
</network>
```

## Networking

Depending on your installation (VMs, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.â€‹), there are multiple ways to configure Hazelcast networking. The default configuration is designed to work in standalone mode. Distribution mode is not relevant to most use cases and not recommended.

If you need to run Hazelcast in a cluster, the simplest way is to enable multicast:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<hazelcast xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config
           http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config/hazelcast-config-4.1.xsd">

    <network>
        <join>
            <auto-detection enabled="false"/>
            <!-- Enable multicast to allow hazelcast discovers other nodes -->
            <multicast enabled="true" />
        </join>
    </network>
</hazelcast>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
More information can be found in the [Hazelcast documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs), including how to configure Hazelcast as a cluster.
{% endhint %}

## Cache resource management

API publishers can create Cache resources to:

* Cache upstream of a response with the [Cache policy](broken-reference)
* Cache access tokens with the [OAuth2 policy](broken-reference)

The default distribution includes the [Cache ](cache.md)resource plugin, which stores content in-memory and is locally managed on each Gateway node of the installation.

Configuration of Cache resources cannot be managed using the `hazelcast.xml` file. The configuration is directly defined on the Cache resource.

## Persistent cache

APIM also supports the Gravitee [Cache Redis](../policies/resources.md#cache-redis) resource plugin, based on [Redis](https://redis.io/documentation). This plugin is not in the default distribution, but can be [downloaded](https://download.gravitee.io/#graviteeio-apim/plugins/resources/gravitee-resource-cache-redis/) and deployed with these [instructions](../getting-started/plugins/#deployment).
