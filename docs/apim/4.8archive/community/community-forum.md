## **Have we met before?**

Welcome to the club! We’d love to know more about you. Please do stop by the [Hello category ](http://community.gravitee.io/c/hello-salut-hola-n-h-o-namaste-privet-ciao/)and tell us bit about yourself.

## **I need some help!**

* Do your own research first. Have you checked the documentation? Have you checked out the [FAQs](http://community.gravitee.io/c/frequently-asked-questions)? Did you do a search in the forum? It might be that your question has already been answered!
* Post in the correct category. Not only will this speed up getting an answer, it’ll make it easier for others to find an answer to a similar question in the future.
* Be detailed in your question. What version are you using? What environment is involved? How did you get to your current challenge? What have you tried already? What were you expecting to happen? This level of detail will really help the community help you.
* Posting some config file? Providing a snippet of your logs? Please make sure you **remove/blank out** any sensitive information, such as **usernames**, **passwords and IP addresses**.
* Got that answer? Great! Now don’t forget to thank those who helped you, and mark the answer as the solution.
