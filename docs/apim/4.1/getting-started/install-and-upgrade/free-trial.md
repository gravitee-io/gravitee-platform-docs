# Enterprise Trial

The easiest way to get started with Gravitee is through the free enterprise trial. The trial includes access to [Gravitee Enterprise Edition (EE) features](../../overview/ee-vs-oss/README.md) like Alert Engine, a no-code API Designer with unlimited data models, monetization capabilities, and advanced protocol mediation options.

The enterprise trial can be accessed by registering with Gravitee Cockpit (GC), which is a web application for centrally managing Gravitee environments and installations.

To access the enterprise trial, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [Gravitee's website](https://gravitee.io) and select **Start Trial** or navigate directly to [GC to register](https://auth.gravitee.cloud/cockpit-master/register?response\_type=code\&client\_id=fd45d898-e621-4b12-85d8-98e621ab1237\&state=bWQ2dWU3NGxFYWMwUUNNNC5DYTdYVXl-clYxMTFGN2g0U2c3RmFzekJRY2VW\&redirect\_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcockpit.gravitee.io\&scope=openid+profile+email+offline\_access\&code\_challenge=rVUojdY7FLgteTUgg-c\_znihD1vTNWquNblh3I0w930\&code\_challenge\_method=S256\&nonce=bWQ2dWU3NGxFYWMwUUNNNC5DYTdYVXl-clYxMTFGN2g0U2c3RmFzekJRY2VW\&hubspotutk=a401cc1863281292853dd4f3e0a4bd9c).
2. Fill out and submit the registration form.
3. Walk through the setup guide to initialize your Enterprise trial.

After you complete registration and your enterprise trial has initialized, you will receive an email with a link to access Gravitee Cockpit.

During the free trial period, you will have access to all of the features and capabilities of Gravitee Enterprise Edition, including advanced analytics, customizable dashboards, and integration with third-party systems. After the free trial period has ended, you can choose to upgrade to the Enterprise edition or continue using the open-source version of Gravitee.
