# API Configuration

## Introduction

After you've created your APIs, you can then further configure them using both the Gravitee API defintion and the Gravitee APIM console. This section focuses on how to configure APIs using the APIM Console.

Please note that, as of Gravitee APIM 4.0, API configuration slightly differs for v2 and v4 APIs. We have split this section into two main components to mirror this difference:

* v4 API configuration guides
* v2 API configuration guides

Please refer to the relevant API configuration guides section based on the kinds of APIs you have created and need to configure using Gravitee.
