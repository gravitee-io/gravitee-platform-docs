# Overview

The Developer Portal is a web application that provides a simplified, user-friendly interface tailored to the API consumption process. It acts as a centralized catalog where internal and external API consumers can find and subscribe to APIs that are developed, managed, and deployed by API publishers.

Gravitee offers two implementations of the Developer Portal:&#x20;

* The classic Developer Portal, which is highly configurable using JavaScript
* The new Developer Portal, which can be customized exclusively via the UI, without any code

The classic Developer Portal provides a solid foundation for the scope and treatment of information, both functionally and conceptually. It is designed to be customizable primarily through code and offers significant flexibility in how it can be configured.

The new Developer Portal uses a modern set of component libraries and UI frameworks to provide a robust off-the-shelf solution. Customization of the new Developer Portal does not require any code. Instead, changes to colors, logos, and fonts can easily be configured using only the UI.

While most features in either Developer Portal are also available in the Management Console (see the [API Exposure guide](broken-reference)), each portal serves as the single location where users can perform a variety of actions:

* API consumers can easily discover and explore APIs, read documentation, test API endpoints, and manage API subscriptions.&#x20;
* API publishers can manage access to APIs, create API documentation, generate API keys, and view API analytics.&#x20;
* Administrators can customize the look and feel of the Developer Portal to deliver an on-brand experience to external API consumers.&#x20;
