# Subscriptions

## Overview

The **Subscriptions** section allows you to view and manage subscriptions and shared API keys via the following headers:

* [Subscriptions](subscriptions.md#subscriptions)
* [Shared API Keys](subscriptions.md#shared-api-keys)

## Subscriptions

From the **Subscriptions** header you can view, filter, and delete subscriptions. Subscriptions are tagged by security type, the plan and API they belong to, the times at which they were created, processed, started, and ended, and their status.&#x20;

To create a new subscription, click **+ Create a subscription** and search for the API you'd like to subscribe to. Refer to the [subscription](../subscriptions.md) documentation for more information.

## Shared API Keys

Under the **Shared API Keys** header you can view the API keys that are shared with all application subscriptions that have an API\_KEY plan.&#x20;
