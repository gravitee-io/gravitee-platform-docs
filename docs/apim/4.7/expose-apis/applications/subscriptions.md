# Subscriptions

## Overview

The **Subscriptions** section allows you to view and manage subscriptions and shared API keys.

## Subscriptions

From the **Subscriptions** header, you can view, filter, and delete subscriptions. Subscriptions are tagged by security type, the plan and API they belong to, the times at which they were created, processed, started, and ended, and their status.

To filter subscriptions, use the **API** and **API Key** search fields and/or the **Status** drop-down menu. Subscriptions can have a status of accepted, closed, paused, pending, rejected, or resumed.

To create a new subscription, click **+ Create a subscription** and search for the API you'd like to subscribe to. Refer to the [subscription](../subscriptions.md) documentation for more information.

## Shared API Keys

Under the **Shared API Keys** header, you can view the API keys that are shared with all application subscriptions that have an API\_KEY plan.
