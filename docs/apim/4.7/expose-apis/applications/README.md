# Applications

## Overview

To access Gravitee APIs, consumers must register an application and subscribe to a published API plan. Applications act on behalf of the user to request tokens, provide user identity information, and retrieve protected resources from remote services and APIs.

The sections below describe how to use the APIM Console to create an application.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before a consumer can create an application, an admin must define the types of applications that API consumers are allowed to create. Refer to [this](./) documentation for more information.
{% endhint %}
