# Management API Reference

## Overview

The Gravitee Management API is the programmatic interface to the Gravitee APIM backend. The Management API consists of two main subcomponents:

* The **management** component. This component exposes the core functionality of APIM. For example, creating APIs, deploying APIs to the gateway, and analytics.&#x20;
* The **portal** component. This component exposes endpoints for listing and managing APIs and applications in Gravitee's Developer Portal UI. Also, you can use the portal API endpoints to build custom developer portals.

Gravitee V4 and Federated APIs are managed within the **v2** subcomponent of the management API. You can access the v2 subcomponent through the `/management/v2` subpath.
