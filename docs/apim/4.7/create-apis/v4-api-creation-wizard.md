# v4 API Creation Wizard

## Overview

The v4 API creation wizard makes it easy to create new Gateway APIs from scratch. To access the v4 API creation wizard:

1. Log in to your APIM Console
2. Click on **APIs** in the left nav
3. In the Create New API , click on **Create V4 API**.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (140).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The API creation wizard comprises several steps, each of which requires you to define certain sets of information.

## API details

Define a name, version number, and description for your API.

The name and version number are required, but we also recommend giving your API a description so that it is more easily understood and managed by internal users.

## Entrypoints

Choose how you want to expose your backend.

* [**Proxy Generic Protocol**](v4-api-creation-wizard.md#generic-proxy-entrypoints)**:** Use this method if you want to use Gravitee to proxy backend REST APIs, SOAP APIs, WebSocket Server, gRPC, or GraphQL over HTTP or TCP. You will not be able to enforce policies at the message level.
* [**Protocol Mediation**](v4-api-creation-wizard.md#protocol-mediation-entrypoints)**:** Use this method if you want to expose backend event brokers, such as Kafka and MQTT.
* **Kafka Protocol:** Refer to the [Kafka documentation](../kafka-gateway/create-kafka-apis.md) if you want to proxy the native Kafka protocol with the Gravitee Gateway acting as a Kafka broker to Kafka clients.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Gravitee documentation adopts concise terminology to differentiate between these API types:

**HTTP proxy API:** An API created using **Proxy Generic Protocol** and called over HTTP

**TCP proxy API:** An API created using **Proxy Generic Protocol** and called over TCP

**Message API:** An API created using **Protocol Mediation**
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/v4 step 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Generic proxy entrypoints

If you chose **Proxy Generic Protocol**, select either HTTP Proxy or TCP Proxy as your entrypoint.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/v4 3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The configuration details for each proxy entrypoint selection are discussed below.

<details>

<summary>HTTP Proxy</summary>

* **Context path:** The URL of your API. For example, if your URL is `[https://apim-master-gateway.team-apim.gravitee.dev/myAPI]`, then `[/myAPI]` is the context path.
* **Virtual hosts:** Enabling virtual hosts requires you to define your **virtual host** and optionally enable **override access**.

</details>

<details>

<summary>TCP Proxy</summary>

* **Host:** The name of the host. Duplicate hostnames cannot be entered for the current API.

</details>

### Protocol mediation entrypoints

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Enterprise only**

The ability to create APIs with message API entrypoints is an [Enterprise Edition](../overview/enterprise-edition.md) capability. To learn more about Gravitee Enterprise and what's included in various enterprise packages:

* [Book a demo](https://app.gitbook.com/o/8qli0UVuPJ39JJdq9ebZ/s/rYZ7tzkLjFVST6ex6Jid/)
* [Check out the pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing)
{% endhint %}

Gravitee supports several different types of entrypoints that cater to different protocols and use cases:

<table><thead><tr><th width="198">Entrypoint</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="v4-api-creation-wizard.md#http-get">HTTP GET</a></td><td>Front a backend or data source with a Gateway REST API that supports the HTTP GET request.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="v4-api-creation-wizard.md#http-post">HTTP POST</a></td><td>Front a backend or data source with a Gateway REST API that supports the HTTP POST request.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="v4-api-creation-wizard.md#server-sent-events">Server-sent events</a></td><td>Front a backend or data source with a Gateway SSE API for unidirectional communication between server and client.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="v4-api-creation-wizard.md#webhook">Webhook</a></td><td>Front a backend or data source with a Gateway Webhook API. This allows consumers to subscribe to the Gravitee Gateway via Webhook and then retrieve streamed data in real-time from a backend data source, via the Gateway, over the consumer's Webhook callback URL.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="v4-api-creation-wizard.md#websocket">WebSocket</a></td><td>Front a backend or data source with a Gateway WebSocket API. This allows a consumer to retrieve and send streamed events and messages in real-time.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/v4 wizard_step 2 message entrypoints.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you select your entrypoint(s), configure the fields common to all entrypoints:

1. **Context path:** The URL of your API. For example, if your URL is `[https://apim-master-gateway.team-apim.gravitee.dev/myAPI]`, then `[/myAPI]` is the context path.
2. **Virtual hosts:** Enabling virtual hosts requires you to define your **virtual host** and optionally enable **override access**.

The following sections describe the additional configuration settings for each protocol mediation entrypoint type.

<details>

## Endpoints

Gateway endpoints define the protocol and configuration by which the Gateway API will fetch data from or post data to the backend API. Your endpoints will be dictated by the API architecture that you selected earlier.

* [Proxy Generic Protocol](v4-api-creation-wizard.md#generic-proxy-endpoints)
* [Protocol Mediation](v4-api-creation-wizard.md#protocol-mediation-endpoints)

{% hint style="info" %}
The endpoint configuration will determine the endpoint groupâ€™s default configuration. By default, the endpoint will inherit the configuration of the group.

By default, the endpoint group will be named **Default \<endpoint type> group** and the endpoint will be named **Default \<endpoint type>**, e.g., **Default TCP proxy group** and **Default TCP proxy**.
{% endhint %}

Individual plan configurations as they pertain to each API type are described in detail below.

### HTTP proxy API

<details>

<summary>API Key</summary>

Select **API Key** from the **+ Add plan** drop-down menu, then define general details, configuration settings, and restrictions.

#### General

You must enter a value in the **Name** field. Modifying the other configuration parameters is optional.

1. **Name**
2. **Description**
3. **Characteristics**
4. **Conditions:** Select a pre-existing page of general conditions
5. **Subscriptions:** Choose whether to auto-validate subscriptions, require a message from a consumer during subscription, and/or present a message to the consumer upon subscription.
6. **Deployment:** Select sharding tags
7. **Access control:** Select any Groups within APIM that you do not want to have access to this API.

#### Configuration

* (Optional) Choose whether to propagate your API key to upstream APIs.
* (Optional) Use the [Gravitee Expression Language](../getting-started/gravitee-expression-language.md) to define additional selection rules. If you are managing multiple plans that share the same type, this will help the plan selection process.

#### Restrictions

Choose to enable any of the following.

* **Rate limiting:** Specify the maximum number of requests that an application can make within a given number of seconds or minutes, then:
  * Enable or disable **Non-strict mode**: this enables rate limiting to be applied in an asynchronous manner, which results in the distributed counter value not being strict.
  * Enable or disable **Add response headers**.
  * Define your rate limit's **Key**.
  * Choose whether to use the custom key to identify the consumer, regardless of subscription and plan.
  * Define the **max request count** (this can be a static or dynamic count).
  * Define the **time duration** (e.g., a one-second time interval within which to apply the request limitation).
  * Define the **time unit**.
* **Quota:** Define a rate limit over a period of hours, days, or months. If you choose this, you will need to define the same settings that are applicable to rate limiting (see above).
* **Resource filtering:** Restricts resources based on defined whitelist/allowed and/or blacklist/disallowed settings. These are defined by path patterns and methods.

## Documentation

See [Documentation](../configure-v4-apis/documentation.md) to learn how to create documentation for a v4 API.

## Summary

Review your API configuration and choose between the following:

* **Save API:** Creates your API as a Gravitee artifact, but does not deploy it to the Gateway.
* **Save & Deploy API:** Creates your API as a Gravitee artifact and deploys it to the Gateway.
