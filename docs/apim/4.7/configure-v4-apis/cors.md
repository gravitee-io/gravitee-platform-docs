# CORS

## Overview

CORS is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain. For background information on CORS, take a look at the [CORS specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors). This article will focus on how to configure CORS for your API.

{% hint style="warning" %}
WebSocket entrypoints do not support CORS. CORS will not be applied if an API does not contain at least one of the following entrypoints: HTTP GET, HTTP POST, HTTP Proxy, or SSE.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

To configure CORS for an API, follow the steps below.

1. Log in to your Gravitee API Management Console
2. Select **APIs** from the left nav
3. Select the API for which you want to configure CORS
4.  Select the **Edit API** icon&#x20;

5. Select **Entrypoints** from the inner left nav
6.  Select the **Cors** tab&#x20;

7.  Set the following parameters:

    * **Enable CORS:** Toggle to ON to enable CORS.
    * **Access-Control-Allow-Origin:** Define a URI that can access the resource. Enter \* to allow all requests, regardless of origin.

    {% hint style="danger" %}
    A value of \* is not recommended for production environments. By allowing cross-origin requests, a server may inadvertently expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties. For example, if a server includes sensitive data in a response that is accessible via CORS, an attacker could use a malicious website to extract that data.
    {% endhint %}

    * **Access-Control-Allow-Methods:** Select the method(s) allowed when accessing the resource, which is used in response to a preflight request: `GET`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `POST`, `PUT`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, and/or `HEAD`.
    * **Access-Control-Allow-Headers:** Select the HTTP header(s) that can be used when making the actual request, in response to a preflight request. Typically, your request header will include `Access-Control-Request-Headers`, which relies on the CORS configuration to allow its values.
    * **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:** Toggle ON or OFF to indicate whether the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true.
    * **Max Age:** Specify how long (in seconds) the results of a preflight request can be cached. This is optional, and a value of `-1` indicates it is disabled.
    * **Access-Control-Expose-Headers:** Define a list of headers that browsers are allowed to access.
    * **Run policies for preflight requests:** Toggle ON for the API Gateway to execute policies for preflight-requests. By default, this is not enabled.
8. Click **Save**
