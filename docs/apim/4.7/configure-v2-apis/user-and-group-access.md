### Add groups to an API

To give groups access to your API, click **Manage groups** and select the desired group(s) from the drop-down menu. This will give all members of that group access to your API.

### Transfer API ownership

If you are the owner of the API, you can transfer ownership to another member, user, or group. Click **Transfer ownership**, then select **API member**, **Other user**, or **Primary owner group.** Next, define the stakeholder to which you want to transfer API ownership and assign that stakeholder a role.
