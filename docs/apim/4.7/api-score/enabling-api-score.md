# Enabling API Score



{% hint style="warning" %}
API Score is a technology preview. This feature is not recommended for production environments.
{% endhint %}

\
API Score is a technical preview feature and therefore requires you to opt-in to use it. You can opt-in for API Score from the API Management Console. This guide applies to version of Gravitee API management 4.7 and above. If you'd like to enable API Score on earlier versions of Gravitee (4.5 or 4.6), please reach out to Gravitee support.

\
Note that API Score is only available in Gravitee Cloud, or if your self-hosted API Management installation is connected to Gravitee Cloud to enable API score. For more information about connecting your API Management instance to Gravitee Cloud, see [Register installations](https://documentation.gravitee.io/gravitee-cloud/self-hosted/register-installations).\
