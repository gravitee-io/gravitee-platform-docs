# Quick install

{% hint style="warning" %}
* RPM install is not supported on distributions with old versions of RPM. For example, SLES 11 and CentOS 5â€‰. If you use an old version of RPM, install Gravitee APIM with .zip instead. For more information about installing Gravitee APIM with .zip, see [install APIM with .zip](../.zip.md).
* If you use Enterprise Edition of Gravitee, you need a license key. For more information about Enterprise Edition licensing, see [Enterprise Edition](../../overview/enterprise-edition.md).
{% endhint %}

1. To install Gravitee's APIM stack, use the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://bit.ly/install-apim-4x | bash
```
