# Breaking Changes and Deprecations

## Overview

This page describes the breaking changes and the deprecated functionality that may occur when upgrading Gravitee API Management. Here are the breaking changes for versions 4.x of Gravitee and versions 3.X of Gravitee

## Breaking changes from 4.x

Here are the breaking changes from versions 4.X of Gravitee.

### 4.7.0

**Minimum Java requirements updated to Java21**

The minimum version of Java that is required is Java21. If you use a prior version of Java, upgrade Java to Java21.

**Hazelcast**

During a rolling upgrade in Kubernetes, if a pod with the version about to be replaced is still running, mAPI throws these warnings:

`09:36:15.515 [graviteeio-node] WARN c.h.i.impl.HazelcastInstanceFactory - Hazelcast is starting in a Java modular environment (Java 9 and newer) but without proper access to required Java packages. Use additional Java arguments to provide Hazelcast access to Java internal API. The internal API access is used to get the best performance results. Arguments to be used: --add-modules <http://java.se|java.se> --add-exports java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.management/sun.management=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens jdk.management/com.sun.management.internal=ALL-UNNAMED 09:36:24.589 [graviteeio-node] WARN c.h.kubernetes.KubernetesClient - Cannot fetch public IPs of Hazelcast Member PODs, you won't be able to use Hazelcast MULTI_MEMBER or ALL_MEMBERS routing Clients from outside of the Kubernetes network`

Once the pod is terminated, `cache-hazelcast` installs successfully. The upgrade process then continues as expected with the upgrader scripts, which means that there will be a brief downtime when upgrading to 4.7.x.

**Azure API Management update**

There is a new parameter for ingesting Azure APIs. To ingest Azure APIs, you must set `gravitee_integration_providers_0_configuration_subscriptionApprovalType` in your `docker-compose.yaml` and set the `SUBSCRIPTION_APPROVAL_TYPE`  in your `.env` file to `AUTOMATIC` , `MANUAL` or `ALL` .

To keep the previous behavior of Azure API Management, set the `SUBSCRIPTION_APPROVAL_TYPE` to `AUTOMATIC` .

### 4.6.0

**OpenTracing replaced by OpenTelemetry**

OpenTracing has been replaced by OpenTelemetry. If you use OpenTracing with the Jaeger plugin, you must update your configuration to target your OpenTelemetry endpoint.

### 4.4.0

**gateway.management.http.trustall update**

The gateway.management.http.trustall has been renamed to trustALL. By default, trustAll is set to `false`. A public CA or a well configured continue to work.

**gateway|api.services.bridge.ssl.clientAuth no longer use a boolean value**

gateway|api.services.bridge.ssl.clientAuth no longer use a boolean value. Possible values are now the following values:

* `none`. This value was previously false
* `required`. Backward compatibility is maintained, true means required
* `request`.

### 4.0.27

**ssl-redirect option changed to default**

In gateway ingress controller, the ssl-redirect option was changed from "false" to default.
