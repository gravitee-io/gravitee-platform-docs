# Overview

## What is a hybrid deployment?

Hybrid installations use a mix of self-hosted and cloud components to provide flexibility when defining your architecture and deployment. A Gravitee hybrid installation consists of a SaaS control plane and a self-hosted data plane.

In this deployment, a bridge gateway acts as the control plane and the Gravitee Gateway acts as the data plane. The Bridge exposes HTTP services that bridge HTTP calls to the underlying repositories. For example, MongoDB and JDBC. The Gravitee Gateway is a standard API Management (APIM) Gateway. You must replace the default repository plugin with the bridge repository plugin.

<table><thead><tr><th width="225.37383177570098" align="center">Component</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">APIM Console<br>(for API producers)</td><td>A web UI that provides easy access to key APIM Management API services.

AE does not require any external components or a database. Events trigger it to send notifications per pre-configured conditions.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Gateway and Bridge compatibility versions

The Bridge and APIM Gateway versions used for your hybrid deployment must be compatible per the tables below.

The following table lists the Gateway versions supported by each Bridge version.

| Bridge version | Supported Gateway versions |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| 4.4.x          | 4.3.x to 4.4.x             |
| 4.5.x          | 4.3.x to 4.5.x             |
| 4.6.x          | 4.3.x to 4.6.x             |
| 4.7.x          | 4.3.x to 4.7.x             |

The following table lists the Bridge versions supported by each Gateway version.

| Gateway version | Supported Bridge versions |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 4.4.x           | 4.4.x to 4.7.x            |
| 4.5.x           | 4.5.x to 4.7.x            |
| 4.6.x           | 4.6.x to 4.7.x            |
| 4.7.x           | 4.7.x                     |
