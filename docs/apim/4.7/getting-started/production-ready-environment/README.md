# Production-ready Environment

## Overview

The default settings created during APIM installation can be useful for testing your new instance. However, some may not be suitable for a production environment, where security is more of a consideration. This guide highlights the APIM settings that require special attention when migrating to a production environment.&#x20;

## Security checklist

The following high-level checklist links to the details of how and why you would enforce each list item.&#x20;

The objective is not to apply all of the recommendations, but to ensure that all configurations have been made with caution.

**Configuring APIM**

APIM includes many other configuration options and every environment is unique. However you configure new settings (via the `gravitee.yml` file, APIM Console, or environment and system variables) it is important to understand that one configuration type can override another.
