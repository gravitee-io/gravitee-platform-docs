# Create Kafka APIs

## Introduction

Gravitee Kafka APIs apply Gravitee API Management (APIM) capabilities directly to the Kafka protocol. Kafka APIs are based on the Gravitee [v4 API definition](../create-apis/overview.md#gravitee-v4-apis). A Gravitee API definition is a JSON representation of everything that the APIM Gateway needs to know for it to proxy, apply policies to, and to create plans for your Gravitee APIs and their transactions. You can create Kafka APIs through the API creation wizard UI, or via the [management API](https://app.gitbook.com/o/8qli0UVuPJ39JJdq9ebZ/s/ySqSVpDHfKA0fNml1fVO/).

{% hint style="info" %}
API consumers call or subscribe to Gateway APIs to retrieve data or functionality exposed by backend services. Gravitee defines three different types of Gateway APIs: proxy APIs, message APIs, and native APIs. These are differentiated by whether they proxy REST or event-driven APIs, and whether the Gravitee Gateway performs [protocol mediation](../create-apis/overview.md#protocol-mediation) or proxies the native protocol.
{% endhint %}

## The creation wizard

The API definitions for Kafka APIs can be generated using the APIM Console's API creation wizard, which is a UI-based tool that makes it easy to create Kafka APIs from scratch. To access the API creation wizard:

1. Log in to your APIM Console
2. Click on **APIs** in the left nav
3. In the Create New API , click on **Create V4 API**.

The API creation wizard comprises several steps, each of which requires you to define certain sets of information:

* [API details](create-kafka-apis.md#step-1-api-details)
* [Entrypoints](create-kafka-apis.md#step-2-entrypoints)
* [Endpoints](create-kafka-apis.md#step-3-endpoints)
* [Security](create-kafka-apis.md#step-4-security)
* [Documentation](create-kafka-apis.md#step-5-documentation)
* [Summary](create-kafka-apis.md#step-6-summary)

## API details

Define a name, version number, and description for your API.

The name and version number are required, but we also recommend giving your API a description so that it is more easily understood and managed by internal users.

## Entrypoints

When choosing how you want to expose your backend, you will be presented with three options: Proxy Generic Protocol, Protocol Mediation, and Kafka Protocol.

Select Kafka Protocol to create a Kafka API. Kafka APIs proxy the native Kafka protocol, with the Gravitee Gateway acting as a Kafka broker to Kafka clients.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/A1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The only field to configure for the Kafka API entrypoint is the **Host prefix**, for which you should enter the host name. If the default hostname is set, you only need to enter the prefix. This is used to uniquely identify your API server on the gateway.

## Endpoints

The Kafka endpoint configuration is the Kafka cluster being proxied by your API. Configure the bootstrap server list and security protocol to talk to the cluster.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/A3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Of the following configuration settings, only entering a host/port pair is required. Modifying any other configuration parameters is optional.

1. Define the comma-separated list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.
2. Select **PLAINTEXT**, **SASL\_PLAINTEXT**, **SASL\_SSL**, or **SSL** from the drop-down menu to define your Kafka-specific authentication flow:
   * **PLAINTEXT:** No further security config necessary.
   * **SASL\_PLAINTEXT:** Choose NON&#x45;**,** GSSAPI, OAUTHBEARER, OAUTHBEARER\_TOKEN, PLAIN, SCRAM\_SHA-256, or SCRAM-SHA-512
     * **NONE:** No further security config necessary.
     * **AWS\_MSK\_IAM:** Enter the JAAS login context parameters.
     * **GSSAPI:** Enter the JAAS login context parameters.
     * **OAUTHBEARER:** Enter the OAuth token URL, client ID, client secret, and scopes to request when issuing a new token.
     * **OAUTHBEARER\_TOKEN:** Provide your custom token value.
     * **PLAIN:** Enter the username and password to connect to the broker.
     * **SCRAM\_SHA256:** Enter the username and password to connect to the broker.
     * **SCRAM\_SHA512:** Enter the username and password to connect to the broker.
   *   **SSL:** Choose whether to enable host name verification, then use the drop-down menu to configure a truststore type

       * **None**
       * **JKS with content:** Enter binary content as base64 and the truststore password.
       * **JKS with path:** Enter the truststore file path and password.
       * **PKCS#12 / PFX with content:** Enter binary content as base64 and the truststore password.
       * **PKCS#12 / PFX with path:** Enter the truststore file path and password.
       * **PEM with content:** Enter binary content as base64 and the truststore password.
       * **PEM with path:** Enter the truststore file path and password.

       and a keystore type

       * **None**
       * **JKS with content:** Enter the keystore password, the key's alias, the key password, and the binary content as base64.
       * **JKS with path:** Enter the keystore password, the key's alias, the key password, and the keystore file path.
       * **PKCS#12 / PFX with content:** Enter the keystore password, the key's alias, the key password, and the binary content as base64.
       * **PKCS#12 / PFX with path:** Enter the keystore password, the key's alias, the key password, and the keystore file path.
       * **PEM with content:** Enter the certificate and private key.
       * **PEM with path:** Enter the certificate path and private key path.
   * **SASL\_SSL:** Configure for both **SASL\_PLAINTEXT** and **SSL**.

## Security

Define a plan to secure, monitor, and transparently communicate information on how to access your Kafka API. The plan types presented are the same as the plan types used for regular HTTP APIs in Gravitee, but map to a Kafka authentication equivalent.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/A4.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Gravitee automatically assigns each API a Default Keyless plan, which grants public access. Click **+ Add plan** to create additional plans.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Kafka APIs cannot have published plans with conflicting authentication. In order to automatically deploy your API, add either a Keyless plan, which grants public access, or remove the Default Keyless plan and add one or more plans with authentication.
{% endhint %}

The Gravitee plans supported by Kafka APIs are summarized below, in increasing order of security

<table><thead><tr><th width="201">Plan</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Keyless (public)</td><td>When configured, this plan does not add security. It is considered an "open" plan.</td></tr><tr><td>API Key</td><td>The gateway only accepts connections from clients that pass an API key corresponding to a valid subscription to the proxy in the client properties. The API key is used as the password, and the md5 hash of the API key is used as the username, as part of the SASL/SSL with SASL PLAIN authentication method.</td></tr><tr><td>JWT</td><td>The gateway only accepts connections from clients that pass a valid JWT with a client ID claim corresponding to a valid subscription to the proxy in the client properties. This is equivalent to SASL/SSL with SASL OAUTHBEARER authentication, where the JWT is used as the OAuth token.</td></tr><tr><td>OAuth2</td><td>The gateway only accepts connections from clients that pass a valid OAuth token with a client ID corresponding to a valid subscription to the proxy in the client properties. This is equivalent to SASL/SSL with SASL OAUTHBEARER authentication.</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
To learn more about how plans function in Gravitee, refer to the [plans](../expose-apis/plans/) documentation. mTLS plans are not yet supported for Kafka APIs.

## Documentation

See [Documentation](../configure-v4-apis/documentation.md) to learn how to create documentation for a v4 API. You can add Markdown, OpenAPI, or AsyncAPI docs pages for v4 APIs.

## Summary

Review your API configuration and choose between the following:

* **Save API:** Creates your API as a Gravitee artifact, but does not deploy it to the Gateway.
* **Save & Deploy API:** Creates your API as a Gravitee artifact and deploys it to the Gateway.
