# Managing Factors

## Overview

Gravitee Access Management (AM) supports various factors out of the box. These factors can be used as MFA for protecting user account access.

Factors are created and managed on Security Domain level, and can then be re-used across all of your applications within that Security Domain. \
\
Some factors also require a [**Resource**](../../resources.md).

## Create a factor

1. In AM Console UI, click **Settings > Multifactor Auth**.
2. Click the plus icon.
3.  Select the factor type and click **Next.**&#x20;
