# Alternative Methods

## Overview

If your users are unable to sign in to their account with their primary MFA factor, they can use an alternative verification method to recover access.

{% hint style="info" %}
To add an alternative verification method, your applications can use the [Self-service account management API.](../../user-management/self-service-account-management.md)
{% endhint %}

## Sign in another way

1. Sign in to your account.
2. In the **MFA Challenge** page, click **Having trouble ? Try other options**.
