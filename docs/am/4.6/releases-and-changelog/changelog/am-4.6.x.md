{% hint style="info" %}
When managing deployments using Helm, please note that the default startup, liveness, and readiness probes now use the httpGet method by default to request the internal API on the `/_node/health` endpoint. As a result, the internal API listens on `0.0.0.0` to allow the kubelet to check the component's status. If you don't provide custom probe definitions and have explicitly defined either the `api.http.services.core.http.host` or the `gateway.http.services.core.http.host`, ensure the value is set to `0.0.0.0`; otherwise, the probes will fail.

<summary>What's new</summary>

### Twilio Resource

The new version of the Twilio resource for SMS or Call factors allows you to specify the templateSid as configuration option.

### LDAP Identity Provider

The new version of the LDAP identity provider grant you access to the Operational Attributes linked to the user profile coming from the LDAP server. (**NOTE:** If this option is enable, Opertational Attributes will be accessible using the User Mapper.)

### User Migration

For users migrations from an alternative OIDC provider to Access Management, you now have the capability to define the `lastPasswordReset` attribute so a password policy with password expiry will request a password reset according to the value provided during the migration. This attribute is accepted only during user creation through the SCIM protocol or the Management API.

### Audit Logs

Additional audit logs have been added on SCIM endpoint to track failing user creations or updates due to an invalid password. In additiopn, a distinction is made between user login with password against using passwordless in a way that the dashboard now expose these information.

### Bulk action for user provisioning

User provisioning is now possible using Bulk actions to create, update or delete users. A dedicated endpoint has been added on the Management API and the SCIM protocol exposed by the Gateway implement the Bulk endpoint (only for the users, groups are currently not managed)

### New Certificate plugin

A key pair registered in AWS Cloud HSM can be used to sign an tokens generated by Access Management by using the new "AWS Cloud HSM" certificate plugin.

<summary>Breaking Changes</summary>

#### SCIM pagination

In previous versions, the `startIndex` parameter used by SCIM paginiation was representing the page number. According to the [specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2) the `startIndex` represent `the index of the first search result desired by the search client` . In order to be align with the specification, the SCIM endpoints of AM Gateway are managing the startIndex as specified by the RFC.
