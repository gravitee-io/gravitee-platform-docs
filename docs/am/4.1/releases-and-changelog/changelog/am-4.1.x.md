The MFA Challenge policy is now available to apply an MFA step during actions such as reset password or unlock account.

The MFA phone call factor can now use Twilio's sendDigits function to direct a call to an extension before playing the message with the MFA code.

**Account linking**

The new Account Linking feature automatically links user accounts with identical user attributes to bypass re-enrollment during authentication.
