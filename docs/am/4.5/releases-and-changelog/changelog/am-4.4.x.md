## Service Account

At the organizational level, it is now possible to create a service account for which you can generate an access token. This makes it convenient to grant access to the Management REST API for your automation processes without relying on a real user account.

A user can also manage personal access tokens associated with their account.

## Support of mTLS authentication for OIDC provider

In addition of the `client_secret_post` and `client_secret_basic` The OpenID Connect identity provider is now capable to the OpenId provider using mutual TLS authentication.

## Force Reset Password

As password is a sensitive aspect of user account security, you now have an option to force a user to reset their password at next sign in. This help you to create an account with temporary password and request a reset password during the first user authentication.

Password Policies are evolving in this new AM release to be more flexible. It is now possible to define multiple password policies at domain level and assign those policies to the Identity provider.&#x20;

## User Management

### Optional email address

Email address can be configured as optional for user profile linked to a domain.&#x20;
