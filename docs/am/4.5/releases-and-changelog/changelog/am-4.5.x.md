{% hint style="info" %}
When managing deployments using Helm, please note that the default startup, liveness, and readiness probes now use the httpGet method by default to request the internal API on the `/_node/health` endpoint. As a result, the internal API listens on `0.0.0.0` to allow the kubelet to check the component's status. If you don't provide custom probe definitions and have explicitly defined either the `api.http.services.core.http.host` or the `gateway.http.services.core.http.host`, ensure the value is set to `0.0.0.0`; otherwise, the probes will fail.

## Gravitee Access Management 4.5 - October 10, 2024

{% hint style="warning" %}
AM 4.5.0 introduce some deprecations which may have an impact on your systems. Please refer to the "Deprecations" section here after for more details.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>What's new</summary>

### Repositories

A new repository scope named `gateway` has been introduced in AM 4.5.0.

### Token generation

For all domains created from AM 4.5.0 the `sub` claim will not represent the user internalID as it was the case previously.

### AWS Certificate plugin

An AWS certificate plugin is now available as EE feature. Thanks to this plugin you can load certificate provided by AWS Secret Manager.

### Reporters

Reporters have been improved in this new version of Access Management:

* additional reporters can be configured as "global" in order to collect audits events coming from all the domains linked to this organization.
* Events for domain creation and domain deletion are now published in the organization reporters.
* The kafka reporter has been improved to manage Schema Registry

### OpenID

We improved the OAuth2 / OpenID specification more strictly regarding the usage of the response\_mode paramet

### Group mapper

Identity Providers now provide a [Group Mapper](../../guides/identity-providers/user-and-role-mapping.md) section.

### Cache Layer

A cache layer has been introduce to limit the Database access during the user authentication flow.

### Upgrader framework

AM now provide the same upgrader framework as APIM meaning that from 4.5.0, no manual scripts need to be executed before an upgrade.
When AM is deployed on kuberneetes using Helm, the value `api.upgrader` needs to be set to `true` so before starting the Management API or the Gateway the helm chart will deploy a job to execute the upgraders. 

</details>

<details>

<summary>Breaking Changes</summary>

### Redirect Uris

On application creation or update `redirect_uris` is now required for application with type WEB, NATIVE or SPA.

### Token generation

For all domains created from AM 4.5.0 the `sub` claim will not represent the user internalID as it was the case previously. The `sub` value is now an opaque value computed based on the user externalId and the identity provider identifier. Even if this value is opaque, it will remain the same for a given user across multiple token generations as per the requirement of the OIDC specification.

<mark style="color:red;">**NOTE:**</mark> For all domains created in previous version, the sub claim remains the user internalId.

### Repositories

A new repository scope named `gateway` has been introduced in AM 4.5.0.

The new gateway scope will manage entities which was previously managed by the `oauth2` scope and the `management` scope:

* ScopeApproval
* AuthenticationFlowContext
* LoginAttempts
* RateLimit
* VerifyAttempt

If you managed to define two differente databases for the `management` and the `oauth2` scopes, please configure the `gateway` scope to target the same database as the `oauth2` scope as ScopeApproval are now managed by the `gateway` scope. If you want to dedicate a database for the gateway scope you will have to migrate the scope\_approvals collection to the new database.

Previously, all the settings related to the repositories where define at the root level of the `gravitee.yaml` with the scope name as section name

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```yaml
management:
  type: mongodb
  mongodb: 
    uri: ...
    
oauth2:
  type: mongodb
  mongodb: 
    uri: ...
```
{% endcode %}

Starting from 4.5.0, a `repositories` section has been introduce to easily identify the settings related to the repository layer.

<pre class="language-yaml" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-yaml"><strong>repositories:
</strong><strong>  management:
</strong><strong>    type: mongodb
</strong>    mongodb: 
      uri: ...
    
  oauth2:
    type: mongodb
    mongodb: 
      uri: ...
  
  gateway:
    type: mongodb
    mongodb: 
      uri: ...
</code></pre>

If you were using environment variable to provide database settings remember to:

* adapt the variable name to include the "repositories" keyword, for example:\
  `GRAVITEE_MANAGEMENT_TYPE=... => GRAVITEE_REPOSITORIES_MANAGEMENT_TYPE=...`
* add the settings for the gateway scope\
  `GRAVITEE_GATEWAY_TYPE=... => GRAVITEE_REPOSITORIES_GATEWAY_TYPE=...`

<summary>Deprecations</summary>

### Audits

For kafka and File reporters, the `status` attibute has been deprecated for removal. The recommanded way to get access to the status is now the `outcome` structure which contains the `status` and a `message` fields. If you are using one of these reporter, please update your consumer to rely on the outcome structure
