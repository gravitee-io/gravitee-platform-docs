# Install & Upgrade Guides

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Changes to Gravitee distribution bundle**

Version 3.18.0 of the Gravitee platform (released on 7th July 2022) has introduced a unified, single distribution bundle for all features available in the Community Edition (CE) and the Enterprise Edition (EE) of Gravitee APIM. This provides a smooth transition from CE to EE functionality and allows you to trial EE features without requiring migration or a standalone EE installation.

If you are a Gravitee CE user and you want to try out EE features, install the unified bundle, request an EE license, apply it to the installation, and restart. You no longer need to download a new EE version of APIM!

In addition, you can now [register for a free time-limited Gravitee Cockpit trial directly on the web](https://cockpit.gravitee.io/register). Registration allows you to access a full EE-grade API Management trial (including Alert Engine), manage Gravitee environments and installations, and design APIs with the Gravitee API Designer (also included in the trial).

For more information about Enterprise Edition licenses, installation, and versioning, see the Enterprise Edition section.

As described in the Introduction to Gravitee Access Management (AM), AM is split into three main components:

* AM Gateway
* AM Management API
* AM Management Console

The guides in this section provide the details of how you can setup, configure, and upgrade your AM environment.&#x20;
