# Account Linking

## Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
Account Linking is a Gravitee Enterprise Edition feature that is available in the default EE distribution. To learn more about Gravitee Enterprise and what's included in various enterprise packages:

* [Refer to the EE vs OSS documentation](../../overview/open-source-vs-enterprise-am/)
* [Book a demo](https://app.gitbook.com/o/8qli0UVuPJ39JJdq9ebZ/s/rYZ7tzkLjFVST6ex6Jid/)
* [Check out the pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing)
{% endhint %}

By default, Gravitee Access Management associates each user identity with a unique user account. For example, if a user first logs in against the Gravitee AM database and then via Google or Facebook, Gravitee AM determines that these logins were initiated by two different users.

A new user is prompted to provide identity attributes during account registration. The Account Linking feature automatically links user accounts from various identity providers to this primary account if the user attributes are identical. A user who is recognized and associated with an existing profile is allowed to authenticate from other accounts without having to re-enroll.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a user is linked to a primary account, it may be useful to access the information supplied by the identity provider in Gravitee Expression Language expressions. The Access Management context allows you to access the latest identity information and the list of all identities linked to the primary account:

* Use the `lastIdentityInformation` attribute to directly access the information supplied by the user's identity provider, e.g., `{#context.attributes['user']['lastIdentityInformation']['test-key']}`
* Use the `identitiesAsMap`attribute to access a map of objects tied to a specific identity provider's ID, e.g., `{#context.attributes['user']['identitiesAsMap']['a826b06e-9f55-42eb-a6b0-6e9f5502eb99']['additionalInformation']['test-key']}`
