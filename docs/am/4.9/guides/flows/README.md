# Flows

## Overview

You can use flows to extend the standard AM behavior by executing [policies](policies/) during the `OnRequest` step of selected stages. Flows can be configured at the security domain level or application level.

## Execution context

Each policy has access to the `Execution Context` to retrieve and set information required to execute the policy code. The `Execution Context` data is propagated for availability in future use cases. For example, custom HTML forms.

The following example retrieves `Execution Context` data using the [Gravitee Expression Language](../am-expression-language.md):

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
{#request}: Current HTTP Request with parameters, headers, path, ...
{#context.attributes['client']}: OAuth 2.0 Client (if available) with clientId, clientName, ...
{#context.attributes['user']}: Authenticated User (if available) with username, firstName, lastName, email, roles, ...
```
{% endcode %}

## Flow configuration

Flow configuration determines where and when policies are applied within AM authentication and authorization processes. Instead of executing policies globally, AM lets you attach them to specific phases of user interaction, which are referred to as flows. Each flow represents a logical step, such as login, registration, consent, or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Policies can be executed at selected steps within flows, typically before or after a user action, such as submitting a form or confirming consent. This approach gives you precise control over security, validation, and customization logic at every key moment of the user journey.

### Key characteristics of flows

Flows lay the foundation for building complex, secure, and user-friendly authentication processes in AM. Flows have the following characteristics:

* **Granularity:** You can assign each policy to the specific flow phase that requires it for precise policy execution. You can also assign multiple policies to multiple phases to cascade policy execution in a single flow.
* **Flexibility:** Multiple flow types are supported, each corresponding to a different authentication or registration event.
* **Step specificity:** For each flow, policies can be run before or after a user action. This increases customization potential.
* **Separation of concerns:** By segmenting flows, you can separate policy logic by context. This simplifies management and troubleshooting.

### Flow types

Access Management supports a variety of flow types. Each type corresponds to a distinct stage in the authentication or user management process. Within each flow, you can define policies to be executed before or after the key user action.

<details>

<summary>ALL</summary>

The **ALL** flow is executed on each incoming request for one of the login, consent or register flows.

</details>

<details>

<summary>LOGIN IDENTIFIER</summary>

The **LOGIN IDENTIFIER** flow allows you to fetch more information or validate incoming data during the providing identity by End-User phase. It is triggered during the phase when the user provides their identifier (e.g., email or username). Policies can be applied before the identifier form is shown or after the user submits their identity.

#### Pre Login Identifier

The Pre step allows you to fetch more information before displaying the Login Identifier HTML Page.

The following attributes are available while processing the policy chain:

* [**Request**](./#request): current HTTP Request
* [**Client**](./#client): the application

#### Post Login Identifier

Post End-User Login Identifier happens after the user has given his identity to the authentication. It allows you to validate incoming data (user identity) before displaying password page.

The following attributes are available while processing the policy chain :

* [**Request**](./#request): current HTTP Request
* [**Client**](./#client): the application
* [**User**](./#user): the End-User identity

</details>
