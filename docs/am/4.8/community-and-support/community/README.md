Welcome to the club! We’d love to know more about you. Please do stop by the [Hello category ](http://community.gravitee.io/c/hello-salut-hola-n-h-o-namaste-privet-ciao/)and tell us bit about yourself.

**I need some help!**

* Be detailed in your question. What version are you using? What environment is involved? How did you get to your current challenge? What have you tried already? What were you expecting to happen? This level of detail will really help the community help you.
* Posting some config file? Providing a snippet of your logs? Please make sure you **remove/blank out** any sensitive information, such as **usernames**, **passwords and IP addresses**.
* Got that answer? Great! Now don’t forget to thank those who helped you, and mark the answer as the solution.
