**Other Gravitee Products**

Gravitee's platform extends beyond just Access Management. For information on enterprise versions of other products, please refer to our [platform overview documentation.](https://documentation.gravitee.io/platform-overview/gravitee-essentials/gravitee-offerings-ce-vs-ee)

## Enterprise AM <a href="#gravitee-community-edition-api-management-vs-gravitee-enterprise-edition-api-management" id="gravitee-community-edition-api-management-vs-gravitee-enterprise-edition-api-management"></a>

The Gravitee AM Enterprise Edition is available as three different packages, each offering a different level of access to enterprise features and capabilities. For more information, please refer to our [pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing).

### Enterprise features <a href="#enterprise-features" id="enterprise-features"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The features below are included in the default enterprise Access Management distribution and do not require additional enterprise plugins
{% endhint %}

* Risk Assessment
* SAML v2

## Enterprise plugins <a href="#enterprise-policy-pack" id="enterprise-policy-pack"></a>

The following packs consist of Gravitee Enterprise Edition plugins. These are not included in the default distribution and must be manually downloaded [here](https://download.gravitee.io/).&#x20;

EE plugins are installed from their respective repositories in GitHub. Gravitee’s EE plugin repositories are private and their names are prefixed as `gravitee-io/gravitee-policy-<plugin-name>`. For example, the Data Logging Masking Policy repository is at `https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-policy-data-logging-masking`.&#x20;

If you have not been granted access to private EE plugin repositories as part of your EE license request process, email [contact@graviteesource.com](mailto:contact@graviteesource.com).

### Enterprise Identity Provider pack <a href="#enterprise-policy-pack" id="enterprise-policy-pack"></a>

## Advanced API monitoring <a href="#advanced-api-monitoring" id="advanced-api-monitoring"></a>

Not technically a part of the Access Management product, Gravitee offers a standalone, enterprise-grade API monitoring solution called Gravitee Alert Engine (AE).&#x20;

AE provides APIM and AM users with efficient and flexible API platform monitoring, including advanced alerting configurations and notifications sent through preferred channels, such as email, Slack and Webhooks. Alert Engine integrates with Gravitee APIM and AM to enable advanced alerting, new dashboards, etc.&#x20;

For more information, please refer to [the Alert Engine documentation](https://documentation.gravitee.io/ae/overview/introduction-to-gravitee-alert-engine).

## Advanced environment management

Gravitee APIM EE includes [Gravitee Cockpit](https://documentation.gravitee.io/gravitee-cloud), which you can use to register multiple APIM environments and installations. This allows you to manage environment hierarchies and promote APIs across higher and lower environments.

## Hosting options

An investment in Gravitee EE is an investment in deployment flexibility, and, optionally, the ability to offload costs associated with maintaining self-hosted Access Management installations. Gravitee Enterprise supports:

* **Self-hosted deployments**: Install and host AM within your own private cloud/environment.
* **Gravitee-managed deployments**: Gravitee hosts and manages all AM components within its own cloud environment.
* **Hybrid deployment**: Gravitee hosts and manages some AM components within its cloud environment while you manage others within your private cloud/environment.

For more information on each, please refer to our [AM Architecture documentation](../am-architecture/).

## Support options

Gravitee offers enterprise-grade support for enterprise customers, available in three different packages: Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Each has different SLAs, benefits, etc. For more information, please [refer to our pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing).
