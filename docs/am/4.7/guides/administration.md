# Administration

## Organizations and environment

Two concepts apply to the setup of **Gravitee Access Management** (AM) installation. Organization and environment.

### Organization

A logical part of your company in the way that makes the most sense in your setup, for example, a region or business unit. In the context of an AM installation it is the level at which shared configurations for environments are managed, such as:

* User permissions to access the AM console
* Roles
* Identity providers to access the AM console

### Environment

An environment in an IT infrastructure, such as development or production. There can be multiple environments linked to one organization. In the context of an AM installation, it is the workspace in which users can manage their security domains and applications.

Examples of environments:

* technical environments such as DEV / TEST / PRODUCTION
* functional environments such as PRIVATE DOMAINS / PUBLIC DOMAINS / PARTNERSHIP

An environment belongs to one organization.

By default, the Community Edition version of AM comes with a default organization and a default environment. For a multi-environment setup, you need an integration with Gravitee Cockpit.

## Roles and permissions overview

You can create administrator roles in AM to grant access to specific areas of a resource (Organization (Platform), Security Domain, Application). Depending on the role permissions, administrators can have full access to this resource. Administrator accounts represent users that can access the administration portal.

### Assignable type

When you log in AM, you are redirected to the portal with at least one `ORGANIZATION` role to be able to see some screens of the platform.

As an owner of a security domain or an application you want to manage your members by giving them roles that make sense only when associated with a `DOMAIN` / `APPLICATION`.

For example, you don’t want to allow a simple user or the person in charge of your application settings to be able to manage the whole platform.

In order to limit the scope of the roles, scopes are bound to what we call an `assignable type`:

* `ORGANIZATION` — role for the whole platform
* `ENVIRONMENT` — role for an environment
* `DOMAIN` — role for a security domain
* `APPLICATION` — role for an application

### Role

A role is a functional group of permissions. There is no limit on the number of roles you are allowed to create.

Some roles are special: they are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

#### **System role**

A System role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change its permissions) used by AM. For example `ORGANIZATION_PRIMARY_OWNER` gives the user all permissions.

#### **Default role**

A Default role is a role used by AM when a role is not specified. For example, new registered users are assigned the default `ORGANIZATION_USER` role.

### Permission

A permission is a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `List`, `Update` and `Delete`. Some permissions can be assigned to multiple types of resources. For instance, the `DOMAIN READ` permission has a different meaning depending on whether it is assigned:

* to a domain: the user can read the specified domain
* to an organization: the user can read all the domains of the specified organization

The following tables list the permissions by assignable type.

All the permissions required to use AM API are described in the [AM V3 OpenAPI descriptor.](../reference/am-api-reference.md)

## Manage roles

To manage roles and permissions:

1. Log in to AM Console.
2. From the user menu at the top right, select **Global settings**.
3. Click **Settings > Roles**, then create a role as described in the examples below.

### Create the `REVIEWER_APPLICATION` role

Let’s imagine we want to create a reviewer role, which allows a user to check if your application configuration is valid.

1. Click the plus icon ![plus icon](https://docs.gravitee.io/images/icons/plus-icon.png) and enter the following values:
   * Assignable type : `APPLICATION`
   * Name : `REVIEWER_APPLICATION`
   *   Description : `Read-only role`

       <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-new-role.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Creating a new role</p></figcaption></figure>
2. Click **CREATE**.

### Configure the `REVIEWER_APPLICATION` role

You must give `READ` permissions to all sections of your application. This allows the user to see the whole configuration of your application.

Click **SAVE** to store the changes.

<figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-role-configure.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Configure a role</p></figcaption></figure>

### Result

Go to your application **Administrative roles** settings section and add a new member with the `REVIEWER_APPLICATION` role. The user `Reviewer User` now has read access to your application.

<figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-role-member.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Reviewer application role</p></figcaption></figure>

## Users

When users log in to AM Console, they are listed in the **Users** section of the **Global settings** menu.

<figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-users.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>User overview</p></figcaption></figure>

If you select a user, you have access to detailed account information and will be able to manage the user’s permissions and groups via with the **Administrative roles** and **Groups** sections.

## Groups

Groups represent user groups where you place members of the same team/partner and set their roles for an APPLICATION (see [Roles and permissions](administration.md#roles-and-permissions-overview) for details). You can associate a group with an application to give members of the group have access to the application.

In the example below, we will create a `FOO Team` group where you can put all members of your FOO team.

### Create the `FOO Team` group

1. Log in to AM Console.
2. From the user menu at the top right, select **Global settings**.
3. Click **Settings > Groups**.
4. Click the plus icon ![plus icon](https://docs.gravitee.io/images/icons/plus-icon.png).
5.  Enter the details of the group.

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-new-group.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Group details</p></figcaption></figure>
6. Click **CREATE**.

### Configure group members

1. Click the settings icon ![settings icon](https://docs.gravitee.io/images/icons/settings-icon.png) next to the `FOO Team` group.
2. Click the **Members** tab.
3.  Add a user by clicking **+ Add members**.

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-new-group-members.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Add members to group</p></figcaption></figure>

### Add the group to an application

Go to the Application you want to modify and click **Administrative roles**.

<figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-adminguide-application-group-members.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Application admins</p></figcaption></figure>

Now the members of the group section will have access to the Application with the group role permissions.

Direct user member permissions and group permissions are merged they apply to the same user.
