# One-time-password (OTP)

One-Time Password (OTP) allows you to use an Authenticator application via your digital device (mobile phone), such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or Free OTP, to generate a one-time code which changes over time and will be used as the second factor to validate a userâ€™s account.

If you enable an OTP type factor for your application, next time your users log in they will see the following screens:

The look and feel of the MFA forms can be overridden. See [custom pages](../../branding/#custom-pages) for more information.
