# MFA with FIDO2

## Overview

FIDO2 plugin implements the functionalities so that the passwordless authentication flow can be used during the multi-factor authentication process. This plugin does not have its own configuration but rather uses an existing **WebAuthn** configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please configure **WebAuthn** under the **Security** section so that the plugin works as expected. Check the [Passwordless (W3C WebAuthn)](../../login/passwordless-w3c-webauthn.md) section for details.
{% endhint %}

## Enrollment scenarios for FIDO2 factor plugin

The enrollment behavior for the FIDO2 plugin depends on a couple of things. First, the way the user decides to log on, and secondly whether the user already has a passwordless device registered or not. The plugin considers the following scenarios during enrollment:

1. The user provides a username and password during the login process and the user does not have a passwordless device registered.
2. The user provides a username and password during the login process. The user does not have a passwordless device registered and decides to execute the passwordless registration process after logging on.
3. The user provides a username and password during the login process and the user already has the device registered for passwordless login.
4. The user selects passwordless login options instead of providing a username and password.

## Enrollment step

The following diagram shows how enrollment occurs for the scenarios mentioned in the previous section. For simplicity, the diagram assumes the application has FIDO2 multi-factor enabled. Notice that this plugin ignores the **MFA challenge** step during the enrollment process in certain cases.

## Challenge step

The following diagram shows only the challenge step. For simplicity, the diagram assumes the user has already enrolled to a FIDO2 factor plugin.
