# Multi-factor Authentication

## Overview

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides a way to add additional steps during the login flow to enforce access control. This ensures that only valid users can access their accounts even if their credentials have been compromised.

It is split into 2 sections:

* **Enroll:** The end user inputs one or several **factors** that will allow them to secure their access.
* **Challenge:** Once the enrollment step is done, the user challenges their configured factor in order to access their account.

Too see how to configure AM and flow charts for MFA enrollment and MFA Challenge, please refer to [Configure MFA for an Application](configure-mfa-for-an-application.md).
