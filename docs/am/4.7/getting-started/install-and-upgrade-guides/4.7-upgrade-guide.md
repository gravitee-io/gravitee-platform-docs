# 4.7 Upgrade Guide

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If your upgrade will skip versions:** Read the version-specific upgrade notes for each intermediate version. You may be required to perform manual actions as part of the upgrade.

**Run scripts on the correct database:** `gravitee` is not always the default database. Run `show dbs` to return your database name.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to upgrade to 4.7 from 4.5 or 4.6
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Upgrade to version 4.7 first, before upgrading to version 4.8 or any higher version.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Java Upgrade

Gravitee Access Management requires Java 21. If you are deploying Access Management with RPM or using the distribution bundle, please ensure to upgrade your java version.
{% endhint %}

## Single Backend deployments

If your current deployment uses a single database to store the data for all repository scopes (management, oauth2, and gateway), no specific actions are required but you have to ensure the dataPlane settings are properly set in the Management API gravitee.yaml.&#x20;

### Helm Chart

When deploying on kubernetes using HelmChart, the values.yaml should remains the same. The dataPlanes section of the Management API will be initialized using the `mongo` or `jdbc` section.

**NOTE**:  When defining repository settings using environment variables, ensure that the Data Plane settings are also defined as explained previously.&#x20;

## Multiple Backends deployments

If your current deployment uses two separate databases—one for scope management information (the control plane) and another for scope gateway and OAuth2 information (the data plane)—a data migration is required. In version 4.7, we aim to provide a clear distinction between entities managed by the Data Plane and those managed by the Control Plane. User profiles, along with other entities, must be moved to the scope gateway and will remain accessible via the Management API through the DataPlane plugin. The affected entities are as follows:

{% hint style="success" %}
To assist with data migration, generic scripts are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-access-management/tree/4.7.x/docs/upgrades/4.7.0). Please review the script corresponding to your backend and modify the variables at the beginning of the script to specify the server, database, and credentials to use. Note that these scripts may not be optimal for your environment, and you might need to modify the settings of the tools used into them. Additionally, you may have tools in place to manage table or collection synchronization more efficiently.
{% endhint %}

We recommend performing the migration during off-peak hours to minimize service disruption or limit traffic on the gateways. The procedure for upgrading to version 4.7 is as follows:

* [Prepare the configurations ](4.7-upgrade-guide.md#adapt-the-access-management-configuration)for the Management API and the Gateway.
* Download and [modify the migration script](4.7-upgrade-guide.md#adapt-the-migration-scripts) to target the source server hosting the scope management (Control Plane) and the destination server (Data Plane) hosting the scope gateway. Ensure to adjust any commands as needed.
* Stop AM services&#x20;
* Perform a backup of your databases.
* Execute the script.
* Validate that the destination server contains the migrated data for the relevant entities.
* Start AM in version 4.7: The Management API will assign the "default" identifier to security domains as the data plane.
* Once the services are up and running, service flow can be restored

{% hint style="info" %}
Some tools provided by database vendors allow for data synchronization without service interruption (such as **mongosync** for MongoDB or specific commands in the case of SaaS offerings). Please refer to your vendor's documentation to identify the most suitable tool for your situation if our procedure and scripts do not meet your production requirements.
{% endhint %}

### Adapt the Access Management configuration

Below is an example of the configuration using two databases—one for the Control Plane (management scope) and one for the Data Plane (gateway and OAuth2 scopes). In summary, the structure of the **gravitee.yaml** remains largely unchanged. Only three new parameters are introduced:

* **use-gateway-settings**: used to share the connection pool between the gateway scope and the OAuth2 scope.
* The **dataPlanes** section: defines the access point to the Data Plane database containing the gateway scope entities. The identifier `default` is required, as this is the value assigned by the upgrade process executed by the Management API during startup.
* **services.sync.permissions:** this parameter allows the roles created for each domain to be loaded into memory. This enables the Gateway to rely on the Control Plane only for synchronization tasks (such as loading the configuration of a domain, application, plugin, etc.). In the event of a Control Plane outage, the Gateway remains functional, as the various configuration elements are already loaded into memory.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Helm chart has been modified to accept the same `repositories` & `dataPlanes` configuration structure as the **gravitee.yaml** in the **values.yaml**. The following example also applies to the chart.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="MongoDB" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
**system-cluster** is a new parameter introduced in version 4.6.4 to allow the reuse of the connection pool from the management or gateway scope in a Mongo Identity Provider plugin. To ensure the Mongo IDP plugin instance uses this shared pool, the "use system cluster" checkbox must be enabled in the form. By default, **system-cluster** is initialized to **management** as in 4.6 the DataPlane split was not in place. With the introduction of the DP Split in version 4.7, it may be more beneficial to set this parameter to **gateway** in order to avoid relying on the Control Plane for user authentication.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Even if the **gateway** scope is specified as the value for the s**ystem-cluster** parameter, the default identity providers initialized during domain creation remain linked to the management scope.

### Adapt the migration scripts

Generic scripts are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-access-management/tree/4.7.x/docs/upgrades/4.7.0). Please review the script corresponding to your backend and modify the variables at the beginning of the script to specify the server, database, and credentials to use.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that these scripts may not be optimal for your environment, and you might need to modify the settings of the tools used into them. If you have tools in place to manage table or collection synchronization more efficiently, use the list of entities defined [previously](4.7-upgrade-guide.md#multiple-backends-deployments) to determine which collections or tables need to be migrated.
{% endhint %}

After reviewing the script on your side, if the commands do not require modification, the only elements that need to be changed are the variables containing the identifiers and the server access points.

```

If this script using **mongodump** and **mongorestore** suits your needs, the directory used to temporarily store the data can be changed via the variable

```bash
# Path for temporary dump
TEMP_DUMP_PATH="/tmp/mongo_dump"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="RDBMS" %}
All the RDBMS scripts expect the same connection seettings and the Database name for the source and the destination clusters.

```bash
# Configuration
SOURCE_DB_HOST="source_host"
SOURCE_DB_PORT="5432"
SOURCE_DB_NAME="source_db"
SOURCE_DB_USER="source_user"
SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD="source_password"

DEST_DB_HOST="destination_host"
DEST_DB_PORT="5432"
DEST_DB_NAME="destination_db"
DEST_DB_USER="destination_user"
DEST_DB_PASSWORD="destination_password"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
