# Install on Red Hat

## Overview

This section explains how to install Gravitee Access Management (AM) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux or Oracle Linux using the `yum` package manager.

{% hint style="info" %}
`rpm` installation is not supported on distributions with old versions of `rpm`, such as SLES 11 and CentOS 5. If you are running one of these versions, you need to [Install Access Management with `.zip` ](install-with-.zip.md)instead.
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

First, you must configure the package management system (`yum`).

1.  Create a file called `graviteeio.repo` in location `/etc/yum.repos.d/` so that you can install AM directly using `yum`:

    ```
    [graviteeio]
    name=graviteeio
    baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/graviteeio/rpms/el/7/$basearch
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1
    gpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/graviteeio/rpms/gpgkey
    sslverify=1
    sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
    metadata_expire=300
    ```
2.  Enable GPG signature handling, which is required by some of our `rpm` packages:

    ```sh
    sudo yum install pygpgme yum-utils
    ```
3.  Before continuing, you may need to refresh your local cache:

    ```sh
    sudo yum -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='graviteeio'
    ```

Your repository is now ready to use.

## Installation Options

You can choose to install the full AM stack or install components individually:

* [Install the full AM stack](install-on-red-hat.md#install-full-am-stack)
* Components
  * [Install AM Gateway](install-on-red-hat.md#install-am-gateway)
  * [Install AM API](install-on-red-hat.md#install-the-am-api)
  * [Install AM Console](install-on-red-hat.md#install-am-console)

## Install full AM stack

This section describes how to install the full AM stack, including all the components and, optionally, dependencies.

### Additional Prerequisites

Before you install the AM stack, you must complete the following configuration.

#### Install Nginx

To install Nginx, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install nginx
```

### Install the AM package (no dependencies)

To install the AM package only, run the following command:

```sh
sudo yum install graviteeio-am-4x
```

### Install the AM package with dependencies

#### Configure dependency repositories

Before you install the AM package, you may need to add third-party repositories.

**MongoDB**

{% hint style="info" %}
For guidance on installing and configuring MongoDB, see the [MongoDB installation documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/).
{% endhint %}

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
echo "[mongodb-org-7.0]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/\$releasever/mongodb-org/7.0/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-7.0.repo > /dev/null

sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
sudo systemctl start mongod
```
{% endcode %}

#### Install AM

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitee-io/scripts/master/am/4.x/install.sh | bash
```
{% endcode %}

### Run AM with `systemd`

To start up the AM components, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start graviteeio-am-4x-gateway graviteeio-am-4x-management-api
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Check the AM components are running

When all components are started, you can do a quick test to see if everything is ok by checking these URLs:

| Component  | URL                   |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| AM Gateway | http://localhost:8092 |
| AM API     | http://localhost:8093 |
| AM Console | http://localhost:8094 |

### Upgrade AM

To upgrade your AM installation, perform the package upgrade, then restart AM:

{% hint style="info" %}
For version 4.1.8 and above, you can upgrade and restart AM to perform an `rpm` upgrade of AM components.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Refer to the [changelog](broken-reference) to follow potential breaking changes.
{% endhint %}

```sh
sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-am-4x
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart graviteeio-am-4x-gateway graviteeio-am-4x-management-api nginx
```

## Install AM Gateway

To install the latest stable version of AM Gateway, run the following command:

```sh
sudo yum install -y graviteeio-am-gateway-4x
```

### Run AM Gateway

These steps assume that you are using the default settings.

To configure AM Gateway to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following commands:

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
</strong>sudo systemctl enable graviteeio-am-gateway
</code></pre>

To start and stop AM Gateway, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo systemctl start graviteeio-am-gateway
sudo systemctl stop graviteeio-am-gateway
```

{% hint style="info" %}
These commands provide no feedback as to whether AM Gateway started successfully. This information is written to the log files located in `/opt/graviteeio/am/gateway/logs/`.
{% endhint %}

### View the logs

When `systemd` logging is enabled, the logging information is available using the `journalctl` commands.

To tail the journal, run the following command:

```sh
sudo journalctl -f
```

To list journal entries for the AM Gateway service, run the following command:

```sh
sudo journalctl --unit graviteeio-am-gateway
```

To list journal entries for the AM Gateway service starting from a given time, run the following command:

```sh
sudo journalctl --unit graviteeio-am-gateway --since  "2020-01-30 12:13:14"
```

### Upgrade AM Gateway

For version 4.1.8 and above, to upgrade an AM component, you can perform a `yum` upgrade and restart AM:

```sh
sudo yum upgrade -y graviteeio-am-gateway-4x
sudo systemctl restart graviteeio-am-gateway
```

## Install AM API

AM API is required to run AM Console. You must install AM API first before you can use AM Console.

To install the latest stable version of AM API, run the following command:

```sh
sudo yum install -y graviteeio-am-management-api-4x
```

### Run AM API

These steps assume that you are using the default settings.

To configure AM API to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable graviteeio-am-management-api
```

To start and stop AM API, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo systemctl start graviteeio-am-management-api
sudo systemctl stop graviteeio-am-management-api
```

{% hint style="info" %}
These commands provide no feedback as to whether AM API started successfully. this information will be written in the log files located in `/opt/graviteeio/am/management-api/logs/`.
