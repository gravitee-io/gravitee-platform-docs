# Log in to AM Console

## How to access AM Console

You access AM Console using the `GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST` URL created during installation.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are running AM with [Docker Compose](../install-and-upgrade-guides/run-in-docker/docker-compose-install.md), the `GRAVITEEIO-AM-UI-HOST` URL is `https://localhost/am/ui`.
{% endhint %}

During the AM installation process, a default administrator account is created. You can use this account to perform all the management tasks provided by AM, such as creating applications and identity providers, registering users, and configuring security.

By default, the login details for the AM Console administrator account are `admin / adminadmin`. You can change this default account in the AM Console by going to **Organization settings > Settings > Providers**. The default account is created with the `Inline` identity provider.

To log in:

1.  Open AM Console.

2. Log in with the administrator credentials. You are redirected to the AM Console dashboard for your default security domain.
3. If you want to change the security domain, open the user menu from the top bar and select the domain from the list.

## AM Console overview

The AM Console I is where you manage all aspects of your account and configuration. It consists of two distinct parts, the **security domain settings** and the **organization settings**.

{% hint style="info" %}
AM Console is accessible by `administrative users` you can manage in the **organization settings** section.
{% endhint %}

### Security domain settings

A security domain lets you manage your end users and their respective applications. It gives the ability to sign your users in by selecting multiple identity providers and building your own custom authentication and authorization journey to match your brand requirements and identity.
