# Certificates

## Overview

Cryptographic algorithms such as KeyStore (private/public key) are used to sign using JSON-based data structures (JWT) tokens. Certificates are used as part of the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocol to sign access, create and renew ID tokens and ensure the integrity of a token's payload.

Certificate definitions apply at the _security domain_ level.

By default AM is able to load certificate using JKS or PKCS12 format you can upload using the console or the REST API. An Enterprise plugin also exists to load PKCS12 certificate from [AWS Secret Manager](aws-certificate-plugin.md).

### Certificate fallback hierarchy

When a client specifies a certificate, the system follows this hierarchy:

1. **Primary**: Use the client's configured certificate
2. **Fallback**: Use the domain's fallback certificate (if configured)
3. **Default**: Use the default HMAC certificate (only if `fallbackToHmacSignature = true`)
4. **Error**: Throw `TemporarilyUnavailableException` if all options fail

This hierarchy ensures that certificate failures do not immediately degrade to HMAC signing, giving administrators control over certificate trust chains.

### Master domain privileges

Master domains can access certificates from all domains to support cross-domain introspection scenarios. Regular domains can only access certificates from their own domain. This privilege is enforced during certificate retrieval and prevents unauthorized cross-domain certificate access.

### Hot-reload via event bus

Certificate settings changes propagate across gateway nodes using the existing event bus. When an administrator updates certificate settings via the Management API, a `DOMAIN_CERTIFICATE_SETTINGS` event is published. Gateway nodes subscribe to this event and reload certificate settings without triggering a full domain reload, minimizing disruption.

## Create certificates

### Java KeyStore (JKS)

Storage for cryptographic keys and certificates is managed in a (`.jks`) file.

{% hint style="info" %}
To generate a new keystore, you can use the Key and Certificate Management Tool `keytool`.
{% endhint %}

```sh
keytool -genkeypair
          -alias mytestkey
          -keyalg RSA
          -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US"
          -keypass changeme
          -keystore server.jks
          -storepass letmein
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Default keys are RS256 (SHA256withRSA). For RS512 keys, add the following options: `-sigalg SHA512withRSA -keysize 4096`
{% endhint %}

### Create a new certificate with AM Console

1. Log in to AM Console.
2. Click **Settings > Certificates**.
3. Click the plus icon ![plus icon](https://docs.gravitee.io/images/icons/plus-icon.png).
4. Choose the certificate type and click **Next**.
5. Give your certificate a name, then enter the details of the keystore file.
6.  Click **Create**.

### Create a new certificate with AM API

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{
           "type": "javakeystore-am-certificate",
           "name": "Java KeyStore",
           "configuration": "{\"jks\":\"{\"name\":\"server.jks\",\"type\":\"\",\"size\":2236,\"content\":\"base64EncodingFile\",\"storepass\":\"letmein\",\"alias\":\"mytestkey\",\"keypass\":\"changeme\"}"
         }'
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/certificates
```
{% endcode %}

### Public keys

You can use public keys to verify a token payload's integrity. To obtain the public key for your certificate:

1. In AM Console, click **Settings > Certificates**.
2.  Next to your certificate, click the key icon.

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-quickstart-profile-public-key.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Certificates list</p></figcaption></figure>
3.  You can copy/paste the public key to use with third-party libraries to verify your tokens.

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-public-key.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Certificate public key</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Gravitee API Management (APIM) comes with a JWT Policy to verify and decode tokens that can be used for your APIs.
{% endhint %}

### Apply the certificate to your application

1. In AM Console, click **Applications**.
2. In the **Settings** tab, click **Certificates**.
3. Choose your certificate and click **SAVE**.

### Certificate for Mutual TLS authentication <a href="#certificate-for-mutual-tls-authentication" id="certificate-for-mutual-tls-authentication"></a>

To mark a certificate as usable for mTLS, you just have to check the "mTLS" usage in the configuration form of your certificate.

{% hint style="info" %}
System certificates can't be used for mTLS authentication as they are self signed certificates generated internally by Access Management.
{% endhint %}

### Custom certificates

<figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-custom-certificate.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Custom certificate diagram</p></figcaption></figure>

AM is designed to be extended based on a pluggable modules architecture. You can develop your own certificate and provide a sign method for tokens.

## Configure certificate fallback

### Prerequisites

- Access Management gateway version
- `DOMAIN_SETTINGS[UPDATE]` permission on the target domain, environment, or organization
- At least one non-system certificate configured in the domain (for fallback selection)

### Gateway configuration

Configure the fallback certificate at the domain level. This setting is stored in the domain configuration and synchronized across gateway nodes via the event bus.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `fallbackCertificate` | string | null | ID of the certificate to use when the primary certificate fails to load or sign |

### Configure certificate fallback with AM API

To configure a fallback certificate, send a PUT request to the Management API endpoint:

```
PUT /organizations/{organizationId}/environments/{environmentId}/domains/{domain}/certificate-settings
```

The request body must include the `fallbackCertificate` property with the ID of the target certificate. The API returns the updated domain object with a 200 OK response.

This operation does not trigger a full domain reload. Instead, it publishes a `DOMAIN_CERTIFICATE_SETTINGS` event that gateway nodes consume to reload certificate settings.

The fallback certificate must belong to the same domain unless the domain is a master domain, which can reference certificates from any domain.

### JWT signing with fallback

When signing a JWT, the gateway first attempts to use the primary certificate provider. If signing fails, the gateway retrieves the fallback certificate from the certificate manager and filters out the fallback if it matches the failed primary certificate (to prevent infinite loops).

The gateway logs a warning message:

```
Failed to sign JWT with certificate: {primary}, attempting fallback using: {fallback}
```

The gateway then attempts signing with the fallback certificate. If the fallback also fails, the original error is propagated. This ensures that transient certificate issues do not immediately fail authentication flows.

{% hint style="info" %}
The fallback certificate selection follows the certificate hierarchy described in the Overview section. All fallback scenarios emit warning logs for operational visibility.
{% endhint %}

## System certificates

When a new domain is created, a certificate is generated for use by the domain applications to sign the tokens. Such certificates are marked as "system" certificates.

### How to define system certificate properties

System certificates are generated based on the Management API settings that allow the definition of:

* the key size (default value: `2048`)
* the certificate alias (default value: `default`)
* the validity of the certificate, measured in days (default value: `365`)
* the algorithm used to sign tokens (default value: `SHA256withRSA`)
* the X.500 name of the certificate (default value: `cn=Gravitee.io`)

To set or modify these values, update the `domains.certificates` section in the `gravitee.yaml` file of the Management API service.

```yaml
domains:
  certificates:
    default:
      keysize: 2048
      alias: default
      keypass: gravitee
      storepass: gravitee
      validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
      algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
      name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
```

You can define these properties in the `values.yaml` file of the AM Helm Chart.

```yaml
api:
  domains:
    certificates:
      default:
        keysize: 2048
        alias: default
        keypass: gravitee
        storepass: gravitee
        validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
        algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
        name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
```

### Certificate rotation

Like all certificates, a system certificate has a given validity period, after which tokens will not be valid anymore. The certificate rotation feature enables you to generate a new system certificate quickly and easily when the previous one is about to expire - just click the "Rotate system key" button to create a new system certificate and assign it to the applications of your domain that are currently using the previous system certificate. The applications update is done asynchronously 10 minutes after the certificate generation in order to avoid JWKS caching issues on the client side.

{% hint style="info" %}
See this [documentation page](../../getting-started/configuration/configure-am-api/) for details on how to configure notifications about certificate expiry.
{% endhint %}

#### How to configure the applications update

To adapt the duration of the applications update after a system certificate generation, update the `domains.certificates.default.refresh` section in the `gravitee.yaml` file of the Management API service.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```yaml
domains:
  certificates:
    default:
      keysize: 2048
      alias: default
      keypass: gravitee
      storepass: gravitee
      validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
      algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
      name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
      # Refresh section is used to define the delay between a system certificate renewal and the applications update to use this new certificate
      refresh:
        delay: 10
        timeUnit: MINUTES
```
{% endcode %}

You can define these properties in the `values.yaml` file of the AM Helm Chart.

```yaml
api:
  domains:
    certificates:
      default:
        keysize: 2048
        alias: default
        keypass: gravitee
        storepass: gravitee
        validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
        algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
        name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
        refresh:
          delay: 10
          timeUnit: MINUTES
```
