# Certificates

## Overview

Cryptographic algorithms such as KeyStore (private/public key) are used to sign using JSON-based data structures (JWT) tokens. Certificates are used as part of the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocol to sign access, create and renew ID tokens and ensure the integrity of a token's payload.

Certificate definitions apply at the _security domain_ level.

By default AM is able to load certificate using JKS or PKCS12 format you can upload using the console or the REST API. An Enterprise plugin also exists to load PKCS12 certificate from [AWS Secret Manager](aws-certificate-plugin.md).

## Create certificates

### Java KeyStore (JKS)

Storage for cryptographic keys and certificates is managed in a (`.jks`) file.

{% hint style="info" %}
To generate a new keystore, you can use the Key and Certificate Management Tool `keytool`.
{% endhint %}

```sh
keytool -genkeypair
          -alias mytestkey
          -keyalg RSA
          -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US"
          -keypass changeme
          -keystore server.jks
          -storepass letmein
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Default keys are RS256 (SHA256withRSA). For RS512 keys, add the following options: `-sigalg SHA512withRSA -keysize 4096`
{% endhint %}

### Create a new certificate with AM Console

1. Log in to AM Console.
2. Click **Settings > Certificates**.
3. Click the plus icon ![plus icon](https://docs.gravitee.io/images/icons/plus-icon.png).
4. Choose the certificate type and click **Next**.
5. Give your certificate a name, then enter the details of the keystore file.
6. Click **Create**.

### Create a new certificate with AM API

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer :accessToken" \
     -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{
           "type": "javakeystore-am-certificate",
           "name": "Java KeyStore",
           "configuration": "{\"jks\":\"{\"name\":\"server.jks\",\"type\":\"\",\"size\":2236,\"content\":\"base64EncodingFile\",\"storepass\":\"letmein\",\"alias\":\"mytestkey\",\"keypass\":\"changeme\"}"
         }'
     http://GRAVITEEIO-AM-MGT-API-HOST/management/certificates
```
{% endcode %}

### Public keys

You can use public keys to verify a token payload's integrity. To obtain the public key for your certificate:

1. In AM Console, click **Settings > Certificates**.
2. Next to your certificate, click the key icon.

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-quickstart-profile-public-key.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Certificates list</p></figcaption></figure>

3. You can copy/paste the public key to use with third-party libraries to verify your tokens.

    <figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-public-key.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Certificate public key</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Gravitee API Management (APIM) comes with a JWT Policy to verify and decode tokens that can be used for your APIs.
{% endhint %}

### Apply the certificate to your application

1. In AM Console, click **Applications**.
2. In the **Settings** tab, click **Certificates**.
3. Choose your certificate and click **SAVE**.

### Certificate for Mutual TLS authentication

To mark a certificate as usable for mTLS, check the "mTLS" usage in the configuration form of your certificate.

{% hint style="info" %}
System certificates can't be used for mTLS authentication as they are self signed certificates generated internally by Access Management.
{% endhint %}

### Custom certificates

<figure><img src="https://docs.gravitee.io/images/am/current/graviteeio-am-userguide-custom-certificate.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Custom certificate diagram</p></figcaption></figure>

AM is designed to be extended based on a pluggable modules architecture. You can develop your own certificate and provide a sign method for tokens.

## System certificates

When a new domain is created, a certificate is generated for use by the domain applications to sign the tokens. Such certificates are marked as "system" certificates.

### How to define system certificate properties

System certificates are generated based on the Management API settings that allow the definition of:

* the key size (default value: `2048`)
* the certificate alias (default value: `default`)
* the validity of the certificate, measured in days (default value: `365`)
* the algorithm used to sign tokens (default value: `SHA256withRSA`)
* the X.500 name of the certificate (default value: `cn=Gravitee.io`)

To set or modify these values, update the `domains.certificates` section in the `gravitee.yaml` file of the Management API service.

```yaml
domains:
  certificates:
    default:
      keysize: 2048
      alias: default
      keypass: gravitee
      storepass: gravitee
      validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
      algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
      name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
```

You can define these properties in the `values.yaml` file of the AM Helm Chart.

```yaml
api:
  domains:
    certificates:
      default:
        keysize: 2048
        alias: default
        keypass: gravitee
        storepass: gravitee
        validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
        algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
        name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
```

### Certificate rotation

Like all certificates, a system certificate has a given validity period, after which tokens will not be valid anymore. The certificate rotation feature enables you to generate a new system certificate quickly and easily when the previous one is about to expire - just click the "Rotate system key" button to create a new system certificate and assign it to the applications of your domain that are currently using the previous system certificate. The applications update is done asynchronously 10 minutes after the certificate generation in order to avoid JWKS caching issues on the client side.

{% hint style="info" %}
See this [documentation page](../../getting-started/configuration/configure-am-api/) for details on how to configure notifications about certificate expiry.
{% endhint %}

#### How to configure the applications update

To adapt the duration of the applications update after a system certificate generation, update the `domains.certificates.default.refresh` section in the `gravitee.yaml` file of the Management API service.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```yaml
domains:
  certificates:
    default:
      keysize: 2048
      alias: default
      keypass: gravitee
      storepass: gravitee
      validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
      algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
      name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
      # Refresh section is used to define the delay between a system certificate renewal and the applications update to use this new certificate
      refresh:
        delay: 10
        timeUnit: MINUTES
```
{% endcode %}

You can define these properties in the `values.yaml` file of the AM Helm Chart.

```yaml
api:
  domains:
    certificates:
      default:
        keysize: 2048
        alias: default
        keypass: gravitee
        storepass: gravitee
        validity: 365             # Validity of the certificate
        algorithm: SHA256withRSA  # Algorithm used to sign certificate
        name: cn=Gravitee.io      # Certificate X.500 name
        refresh:
          delay: 10
          timeUnit: MINUTES
```

## Domain certificate settings

Domain-level certificate settings allow administrators to configure a fallback certificate that is automatically used when a client or application does not have a specific certificate assigned. This feature improves resilience by preventing authentication failures when certificates are missing or unavailable, and provides centralized certificate management at the domain level.

### Certificate selection hierarchy

When signing JWTs or performing cryptographic operations, the system follows a strict priority order:

1. **Client-specific certificate** — The certificate assigned to the client or application
2. **Domain fallback certificate** — The certificate configured at the domain level
3. **Default HMAC certificate** — Used only if `fallbackToHmacSignature` is enabled
4. **Error** — `TemporarilyUnavailableException` if none are available

The fallback certificate acts as a domain-wide safety net, ensuring operations can proceed even when individual clients lack dedicated certificates.

### Fallback certificate resilience

If JWT signing fails with the primary certificate (e.g., due to `SignatureException`), the system automatically retries with the fallback certificate before propagating the error. This retry logic does not apply if the fallback certificate ID matches the primary certificate ID, preventing infinite loops. Successful fallback operations are logged with warnings for audit and troubleshooting.

### Domain isolation

Regular domains can only use certificates where `certificate.domain` matches the domain ID. Master domains can access certificates from all domains for cross-domain introspection. System certificates are now included in the fallback certificate selection pool.

{% hint style="info" %}
Master domains have elevated certificate access privileges to support cross-domain introspection scenarios.
{% endhint %}

### Prerequisites

Before configuring a fallback certificate, ensure the following:

* The domain exists in the organization and environment
* The fallback certificate belongs to the same domain (except for master domains)
* You have `DOMAIN_SETTINGS[UPDATE]` permission on the domain, environment, or organization

### Certificate settings property

Configure fallback certificates at the domain level using the certificate settings object.

| Property | Description | Example |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| `certificateSettings.fallbackCertificate` | Certificate ID to use when no client-specific certificate is configured. Set to `null` to disable fallback. | `"cert-abc123"` |

### Configure a fallback certificate

1. Send a PUT request to `/organizations/{organizationId}/environments/{environmentId}/domains/{domain}/certificate-settings` with the following JSON body:

   ```json
   {
     "fallbackCertificate": "cert-id"
   }
   ```

2. The system validates the certificate:
   * Certificate must exist
   * Certificate must belong to the domain

3. If validation passes, the settings are persisted and a `DOMAIN_CERTIFICATE_SETTINGS` event is emitted.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `DOMAIN_CERTIFICATE_SETTINGS` event allows faster propagation than a full domain reload event.
{% endhint %}

### Remove a fallback certificate

To remove the fallback certificate, set `fallbackCertificate` to `null` or an empty string in the request body:

```json
{
  "fallbackCertificate": null
}
```

### Restrictions

* A certificate configured as the domain's fallback certificate cannot be deleted. Attempting deletion returns HTTP 400 with the error message: `"You can't delete a certificate that is configured as the domain's fallback certificate."`
* Fallback certificate must belong to the same domain as the domain being configured (unless the domain is a master domain)
* Invalid or non-existent fallback certificate IDs are rejected during domain update or patch operations with `InvalidParameterException`
* If the fallback certificate ID matches the primary certificate ID during JWT signing, the system does not retry and propagates the original error
