# Support Model

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
For version 3.18.0 and above: 12-month support model for all minor versions
{% endhint %}

As of version 3.18.0 (released on 7th July 2022), released versions of the Gravitee platform adhere to a new support model.

We now provide 12 months of support for each minor version. A minor version is considered a quarterly release version with a second-digit increment in the version cadence and no third digit, e.g., 3.18.&#x20;

A third digit increment in the version cadence indicates a maintenance version, e.g., 3.18.1. Maintenance versions will be supported for the duration of their "parent" minor version support. For example, 3.18.1 will be supported until the deprecation of 3.18 support.
