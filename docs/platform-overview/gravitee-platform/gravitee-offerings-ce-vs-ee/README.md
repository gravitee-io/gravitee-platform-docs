# Distribution Options

## Introduction

Gravitee offers both a free Community Edition and paid Enterprise Edition of our platform. The versions impact which product(s) and features that you will have access to. Please see the table below that explains the differences as it pertains to products.

We have also included product specific differences between EE and CE. For some (such as APIM), we just link to the APIM-specific page, as there is a lot of content around the many different benefits and features that the enterprise packaging offers.

At the bottom of this page, we also outline the enterprise hosting, deployment, and support options. If you are interested in learning more about the Gravitee enterprise platform, [please feel free to book a demo.](https://www.gravitee.io/demo)

## Enterprise version of Gravitee Cloud

Gravitee EE APIM enables you to register multiple APIM environments and installations using [Gravitee C](../../../gravitee-cloud/README.md)[loud](../../../gravitee-cloud/README.md) This enables you to manage environment hierarchies and promote APIs across higher and lower environments.

## Enterprise version of API Designer

The enterprise version of API Designer enables you to create, export, and push unlimited API data models, whereas the free version limits you to one API data model.

## Enterprise hosting and deployment options

An investment in Gravitee EE is an investment in deployment flexibility, and, optionally, the ability to offload costs associated with maintaining self-hosted API Management installations. Gravitee Enterprise supports:

* **Self-hosted deployments:** install and host APIM within your own private cloud/environment
* **Gravitee-managed deployments:** Gravitee hosts and manages all APIM components within its own cloud environments
* **Hybrid deployment:** Gravitee hosts and manages some APIM components in its own cloud environment while you manage some components in your own private cloud/environment

For more information on each, please refer to our [APIM Architecture documentation](https://documentation.gravitee.io/apim/overview/apim-architecture).

## Enterprise support packages

Gravitee offers enterprise-grade support for enterprise customers. Gravitee offers three different support packages: Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Each has different SLAs, benefits, etc. For more information on each support option, please [refer to our pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing).
