# Condensed Summary of the Spellcheck Workflow

## Overview
This workflow manually runs a spellcheck on a GitHub repository and automatically creates a pull request (PR) with corrections. It ensures accurate spellchecking while enforcing strict rules for:
- **Ignore lists** (words that should not be changed)
- **Case sensitivity** (preserving proper capitalization)
- **Context-aware corrections** (choosing the most appropriate fix based on the sentence structure)

## Workflow Steps
1. **Manual Trigger:** Runs only when manually started via GitHub Actions.
2. **Repository Checkout:** Fetches the repository files for spellchecking.
3. **Dependency Installation:** Installs:
   - `codespell` for spellchecking.
   - `fuzzywuzzy` for approximate string matching.
   - `sentence-splitter` for context-aware corrections.
4. **Ignore List Verification:** Ensures the `spellcheck-ignore.txt` file exists.
5. **Spellcheck & Fixes:**
   - Runs `codespell` to detect errors without applying automatic fixes.
   - Ensures:
     - Case-sensitive corrections match exactly when needed.
     - Lowercase corrections only apply inside URLs, links, and file paths.
     - Weak matches (e.g., "ot" in "hotfixes") are ignored.
     - Context-aware corrections fit the surrounding sentence.
     - No punctuation is modified or inserted.
6. **Applying Fixes to Files:**
   - Reads detected spelling errors.
   - Finds the best correction based on the ignore list and context.
   - Replaces only the misspelled word (no excessive corrections).
   - Preserves punctuation (does not add or remove commas, periods, etc.).
7. **Checking for Changes:**
   - If corrections were applied, a new branch is created.
   - If no corrections were needed, the workflow exits.
8. **Creating a Pull Request:**
   - If corrections exist:
     - Creates a new branch (`spellcheck-fixes-<timestamp>`).
     - Commits the corrected files.
     - Opens a PR summarizing the corrections for review and approval.

## Key Features
- **Context-Aware Corrections:** Uses sentence-level analysis to ensure fixes fit naturally.
- **Strict Case Sensitivity Rules:** Ensures case-sensitive ignore terms remain unchanged when necessary.
- **No Unnecessary Changes:** Prevents partial replacements that might introduce errors.
- **No Extra Files Created:** Removes `spellcheck_report.txt` and `spellcheck_report_raw.txt` to prevent commit issues.
- **Fails Gracefully:** If no changes are needed, the workflow exits without errors.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Incorrect Weak Matches
- **Issue:** The workflow mistakenly matched short words inside longer words (e.g., "ot" in "hotfixes").
- **Fix:** Ensured that short words (< 3 letters) are ignored unless context confirms the correction.

### 2. Case Sensitivity Errors
- **Issue:** Case-sensitive words were sometimes incorrectly converted to lowercase.
- **Fix:** Applied exact-case corrections for words in regular text while keeping lowercase in URLs & file paths.

### 3. Incorrect Changes to URLs & Markdown Links
- **Issue:** Words inside links and file paths were case-corrected incorrectly.
- **Fix:** Introduced strict rules to preserve original case inside URLs, Markdown links, and file paths.

### 4. Context Ignored in Some Corrections
- **Issue:** `"identiy provider"` was sometimes corrected to `"identify provider"` instead of `"identity provider"`.
- **Fix:** Sentence-level analysis ensures logical word choices rather than simple dictionary-based fixes.

### 5. Unwanted Punctuation Modifications
- **Issue:** The workflow added commas where none were needed.
- **Fix:** Implemented strict punctuation preservation rules.

### 6. No PR Created if Files Were Unchanged
- **Issue:** `spellcheck_report.txt` and `spellcheck_report_raw.txt` caused commit failures.
- **Fix:** The workflow no longer generates these files, ensuring a clean commit.

### 7. Handling of Line Numbers in Corrections
- **Issue:** The workflow crashed when `codespell` reported a nonexistent line number.
- **Fix:** Added safe handling to skip missing or out-of-range lines.

### 8. Overcorrection in Known Phrases
- **Issue:** `"automatical validation"` was changed to `"automatically, validation"` instead of `"automatic validation"`.
- **Fix:** Prioritized common technical phrases, ensuring no extra punctuation is added.

## Final Summary
This workflow automates spellchecking, applies strict rules, and prevents unnecessary modifications. It preserves correct formatting and avoids false positives, making it highly reliable for maintaining documentation quality.
